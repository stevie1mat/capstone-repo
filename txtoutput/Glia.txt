Glia
Glia, also called glial cells (gliocytes) or neuroglia, are non-
neuronal cells in the central nervous system (brain and spinal
cord) and the peripheral nervous system that do not produce
electrical impulses. The neuroglia make up more than one half
the volume of neural tissue in the human body.[1] They
maintain homeostasis, form myelin in the peripheral nervous
system, and provide support and protection for neurons.[2] In
the central nervous system, glial cells include oligodendrocytes,
astrocytes, ependymal cells and microglia, and in the peripheral
nervous system they include Schwann cells and satellite cells.
They have four main functions:
to surround neurons and hold them in place
to supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons
to insulate one neuron from another
to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons.
They also play a role in neurotransmission and synaptic
connections,[3] and in physiological processes such as
breathing.[4][5][6] While glia were thought to outnumber
neurons by a ratio of 10:1, recent studies using newer methods
and reappraisal of historical quantitative evidence suggests an
overall ratio of less than 1:1, with substantial variation between
different brain tissues.[7][8]
Glial cells have far more cellular diversity and functions than
neurons, and glial cells can respond to and manipulate
neurotransmission in many ways. Additionally, they can affect
both the preservation and consolidation of memories.[1]

Neuroglia of the brain shown by Golgi's
method
Astrocytes can be identified in culture
because, unlike other mature glia, they
express glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP)
Glia were discovered in 1856, by the pathologist Rudolf
Virchow in his search for a "connective tissue" in the brain.[9]
The term derives from Greek γλία and γλοία "glue"[10]
(English: /ˈɡliːə/ or /ˈɡlaɪə/), and suggests the original
impression that they were the glue of the nervous system.
Derived from ectodermal tissue.

Description
CNS
Astrocytes
The most abundant type of
macroglial 
cell 
in 
the
CNS,[11] astrocytes (also
called 
astroglia) 
have
numerous projections that
link neurons to their blood
supply while forming the
blood–brain barrier. They
regulate 
the 
external
chemical environment of
neurons 
by 
removing
excess 
potassium 
ions,
and 
recycling
neurotransmitters released
during 
synaptic
transmission. 
Astrocytes
may 
regulate
vasoconstriction 
and
vasodilation by producing
substances 
such 
as
arachidonic acid, whose
metabolites 
are
vasoactive.
Astrocytes 
signal 
each
other using ATP. The gap
junctions (also known as
electrical 
synapses)
between astrocytes allow
the messenger molecule
IP3 to diffuse from one
astrocyte to another. IP3
activates calcium channels
on 
cellular 
organelles,
releasing calcium into the
cytoplasm. This calcium
may 
stimulate 
the
production of more IP3 and
cause 
release 
of ATP
through channels in the
membrane 
made 
of
pannexins. The net effect
is a calcium wave that
propagates from cell to
cell. Extracellular release
of ATP, and consequent activation of purinergic receptors on other
astrocytes, may also mediate calcium waves in some cases.
In general, there are two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and
fibrous, similar in function but distinct in morphology and
distribution. Protoplasmic astrocytes have short, thick, highly
branched processes and are typically found in gray matter. Fibrous
astrocytes have long, thin, less-branched processes and are more
commonly found in white matter.
It has recently been shown that astrocyte activity is linked to blood
flow in the brain, and that this is what is actually being measured in
fMRI.[12] They also have been involved in neuronal circuits playing
an inhibitory role after sensing changes in extracellular calcium.[13]
CNS
Oligodendrocytes
Oligodendrocytes are cells that coat axons in the CNS with their
cell membrane, forming a specialized membrane differentiation
called myelin, producing the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath
provides insulation to the axon that allows electrical signals to
propagate more efficiently.[14]
CNS
Ependymal cells
Ependymal cells, also named ependymocytes, line the spinal cord
and the ventricular system of the brain. These cells are involved in
the creation and secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and beat
their cilia to help circulate the CSF and make up the blood-CSF
barrier. They are also thought to act as neural stem cells.[15]
CNS
Radial glia
Radial glia cells arise from neuroepithelial cells after the onset of
neurogenesis. Their differentiation abilities are more restricted than
those of neuroepithelial cells. In the developing nervous system,
radial glia function both as neuronal progenitors and as a scaffold
upon which newborn neurons migrate. In the mature brain, the
cerebellum and retina retain characteristic radial glial cells. In the
cerebellum, these are Bergmann glia, which regulate synaptic
plasticity. In the retina, the radial Müller cell is the glial cell that
spans the thickness of the retina and, in addition to astroglial
cells,[16] participates in a bidirectional communication with
neurons.[17]
PNS
Schwann cells
Similar in function to oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells provide
myelination to axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). They
also have phagocytotic activity and clear cellular debris that allows
for regrowth of PNS neurons.[18]
PNS
Satellite cells
Satellite glial cells are small cells that surround neurons in
sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic ganglia.[19] These
cells help regulate the external chemical environment. Like
astrocytes, they are interconnected by gap junctions and respond
to ATP by elevating the intracellular concentration of calcium ions.
They are highly sensitive to injury and inflammation and appear to
contribute to pathological states, such as chronic pain.[20]
PNS
Enteric glial cells
Are found in the intrinsic ganglia of the digestive system. Glia cells
are thought to have many roles in the enteric system, some related
to homeostasis and muscular digestive processes.[21]
Microglia
23-week fetal brain culture astrocyte
Microglia are specialized macrophages capable of phagocytosis that protect neurons of the central nervous
system.[22] They are derived from the earliest wave of mononuclear cells that originate in yolk sac blood
islands early in development, and colonize the brain shortly after the neural precursors begin to
differentiate.[23]
These cells are found in all regions of the brain and spinal cord. Microglial cells are small relative to
macroglial cells, with changing shapes and oblong nuclei. They are mobile within the brain and multiply
when the brain is damaged. In the healthy central nervous system, microglia processes constantly sample all
aspects of their environment (neurons, macroglia and blood vessels). In a healthy brain, microglia direct the
immune response to brain damage and play an important role in the inflammation that accompanies the
damage. Many diseases and disorders are associated with deficient microglia, such as Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease and ALS.
Pituicytes from the posterior pituitary are glial cells with characteristics in common to astrocytes.[24]
Tanycytes in the median eminence of the hypothalamus are a type of ependymal cell that descend from
radial glia and line the base of the third ventricle.[25] Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, contains
numerous glial types that are functionally similar to mammalian glia but are nonetheless classified
differently.[26]
In general, neuroglial cells are smaller than neurons. There are approximately 85 billion glia cells in the
human brain,[8] about the same number as neurons.[8] Glial cells make up about half the total volume of the
brain and spinal cord.[27] The glia to neuron-ratio varies from one part of the brain to another. The glia to
neuron-ratio in the cerebral cortex is 3.72 (60.84 billion glia (72%); 16.34 billion neurons), while that of the
cerebellum is only 0.23 (16.04 billion glia; 69.03 billion neurons). The ratio in the cerebral cortex gray
matter is 1.48, with 3.76 for the gray and white matter combined.[27] The ratio of the basal ganglia,
diencephalon and brainstem combined is 11.35.[27]
The total number of glia cells in the human brain is distributed into the different types with oligodendrocytes
being the most frequent (45–75%), followed by astrocytes (19–40%) and microglia (about 10% or less).[8]
Most glia are derived from ectodermal tissue of the developing
embryo, in particular the neural tube and crest. The exception is
microglia, which are derived from hematopoietic stem cells. In the
adult, microglia are largely a self-renewing population and are
distinct from macrophages and monocytes, which infiltrate an
injured and diseased CNS.

Total number
Development
In the central nervous system, glia develop from the ventricular zone of the neural tube. These glia include
the oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and astrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system, glia derive from
the neural crest. These PNS glia include Schwann cells in nerves and satellite glial cells in ganglia.
Glia retain the ability to undergo cell divisions in adulthood, whereas most neurons cannot. The view is
based on the general inability of the mature nervous system to replace neurons after an injury, such as a
stroke or trauma, where very often there is a substantial proliferation of glia, or gliosis, near or at the site of
damage. However, detailed studies have found no evidence that 'mature' glia, such as astrocytes or
oligodendrocytes, retain mitotic capacity. Only the resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells seem to keep
this ability once the nervous system matures.
Glial cells are known to be capable of mitosis. By contrast, scientific understanding of whether neurons are
permanently post-mitotic,[28] or capable of mitosis,[29][30][31] is still developing. In the past, glia had been
considered to lack certain features of neurons. For example, glial cells were not believed to have chemical
synapses or to release transmitters. They were considered to be the passive bystanders of neural
transmission. However, recent studies have shown this to not be entirely true.[32]
Some glial cells function primarily as the physical support for neurons. Others provide nutrients to neurons
and regulate the extracellular fluid of the brain, especially surrounding neurons and their synapses. During
early embryogenesis, glial cells direct the migration of neurons and produce molecules that modify the
growth of axons and dendrites. Some glial cells display regional diversity in the CNS and their functions
may vary between the CNS regions.[33]
Glia are crucial in the development of the nervous system and in processes such as synaptic plasticity and
synaptogenesis. Glia have a role in the regulation of repair of neurons after injury. In the central nervous
system (CNS), glia suppress repair. Glial cells known as astrocytes enlarge and proliferate to form a scar
and produce inhibitory molecules that inhibit regrowth of a damaged or severed axon. In the peripheral
nervous system (PNS), glial cells known as Schwann cells (or also as neuri-lemmocytes) promote repair.
After axonal injury, Schwann cells regress to an earlier developmental state to encourage regrowth of the
axon. This difference between the CNS and the PNS, raises hopes for the regeneration of nervous tissue in
the CNS. For example, a spinal cord may be able to be repaired following injury or severance.
Oligodendrocytes are found in the CNS and resemble an octopus: they have bulbous cell bodies with up to
fifteen arm-like processes. Each process reaches out to an axon and spirals around it, creating a myelin
sheath. The myelin sheath insulates the nerve fiber from the extracellular fluid and speeds up signal
conduction along the nerve fiber.[34] In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells are responsible for

myelin production. These cells envelop nerve fibers of the PNS by winding repeatedly around them. This
process creates a myelin sheath, which not only aids in conductivity but also assists in the regeneration of
damaged fibers.
Astrocytes are crucial participants in the tripartite synapse.[35][36][37][38] They have several crucial
functions, including clearance of neurotransmitters from within the synaptic cleft, which aids in
distinguishing between separate action potentials and prevents toxic build-up of certain neurotransmitters
such as glutamate, which would otherwise lead to excitotoxicity. Furthermore, astrocytes release
gliotransmitters such as glutamate, ATP, and D-serine in response to stimulation.[39]
While glial cells in the PNS frequently assist in regeneration of
lost neural functioning, loss of neurons in the CNS does not
result in a similar reaction from neuroglia.[18] In the CNS,
regrowth will only happen if the trauma was mild, and not
severe.[40] When severe trauma presents itself, the survival of
the remaining neurons becomes the optimal solution. However,
some studies investigating the role of glial cells in Alzheimer's
disease are beginning to contradict the usefulness of this
feature, and even claim it can "exacerbate" the disease.[41] In
addition to affecting the potential repair of neurons in
Alzheimer's disease, scarring and inflammation from glial cells
have been further implicated in the degeneration of neurons
caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[42]
In addition to neurodegenerative diseases, a wide range of harmful exposure, such as hypoxia, or physical
trauma, can lead to the result of physical damage to the CNS.[40] Generally, when damage occurs to the
CNS, glial cells cause apoptosis among the surrounding cellular bodies.[40] Then, there is a large amount of
microglial activity, which results in inflammation, and, finally, there is a heavy release of growth inhibiting
molecules.[40]
Although glial cells and neurons were probably first observed at the same time in the early 19th century,
unlike neurons whose morphological and physiological properties were directly observable for the first
investigators of the nervous system, glial cells had been considered to be merely "glue" that held neurons
together until the mid-20th century.[43]
Glia were first described in 1856 by the pathologist Rudolf Virchow in a comment to his 1846 publication
on connective tissue. A more detailed description of glial cells was provided in the 1858 book 'Cellular
Pathology' by the same author.[44]
When markers for different types of cells were analyzed, Albert Einstein's brain was discovered to contain
significantly more glia than normal brains in the left angular gyrus, an area thought to be responsible for
mathematical processing and language.[45] However, out of the total of 28 statistical comparisons between

History
Einstein's brain and the control brains, finding one statistically significant result is not surprising, and the
claim that Einstein's brain is different is not scientific (c.f. Multiple comparisons problem).[46]
Not only does the ratio of glia to neurons increase through evolution, but so does the size of the glia.
Astroglial cells in human brains have a volume 27 times greater than in mouse brains.[47]
These important scientific findings may begin to shift the neurocentric perspective into a more holistic view
of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. For the majority of the twentieth century, scientists
had disregarded glial cells as mere physical scaffolds for neurons. Recent publications have proposed that
the number of glial cells in the brain is correlated with the intelligence of a species.[48] Moreover, evidences
are demonstrating the active role of glia, in particular astroglia, in cognitive processes like learning and
memory[49][50] and, for these reasons, it has been proposed the foundation of a specific field to study these
functions because investigations in this area are still limited due to the dominance of the neurocentric
perspective.[51]
