The neuron contains dendrites that receives information, a cell body called the soma,
and an axon that sends information. Schwann cells make activity move faster down
axon. Synapses allow neurons to activate other neurons. The dendrites receive a
signal, the axon hillock funnels the signal to the initial segment and the initial
segment triggers the activity (action potential) that is sent along the axon towards the
synapse. Please see learnbio.org (https://www.learnbio.org/neuron.html) for

Dendrite
A dendrite (from Greek δένδρον déndron, "tree") or dendron is a branched protoplasmic extension of a
nerve cell that propagates the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the cell body,
or soma, of the neuron from which the dendrites project. Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites
by upstream neurons (usually via their axons) via synapses which are located at various points throughout
the dendritic tree.
Dendrites play a critical role in integrating these synaptic inputs and in determining the extent to which
action potentials are produced by the neuron.[1]
Dendrites are one of two types of protoplasmic protrusions that extrude from the cell body of a neuron, the
other type being an axon. Axons can be distinguished from dendrites by several features including shape,
length, and function. Dendrites often taper off in shape and are shorter, while axons tend to maintain a
constant radius and can be very long. Typically, axons transmit electrochemical signals and dendrites
receive the electrochemical signals, although some types of neurons in certain species lack specialized
axons and transmit signals via their dendrites.[3] Dendrites provide an enlarged surface area to receive
signals from axon terminals of other neurons.[4] The dendrite of a large pyramidal cell receives signals from
about 30,000 presynaptic neurons.[5] Excitatory synapses terminate on dendritic spines, tiny protrusions
from the dendrite with a high density of neurotransmitter receptors. Most inhibitory synapses directly
contact the dendritic shaft.
Structure and function
The extensive dendritic tree of two
hippocampal pyramidal neurons (magenta)
with all incoming synapses genetically
labeled (green spots).[2]
Synaptic activity causes local changes in the electrical
potential across the plasma membrane of the dendrite. This
change in membrane potential will passively spread along
the dendrite, but becomes weaker with distance without an
action potential. To generate an action potential, many
excitatory synapses have to be active at the same time,
leading to strong depolarization of the dendrite and the cell
body (soma). The action potential, which typically starts at
the axon hillock, propagates down the length of the axon to
the axon terminals where it triggers the release of
neurotransmitters, but also backwards into the dendrite
(retrograde propagation), providing an important signal for
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).[4]
Most synapses are axodendritic, involving an axon signaling
to a dendrite. There are also dendrodendritic synapses,
signaling from one dendrite to another.[6] An autapse is a
synapse in which the axon of one neuron transmits signals to
its own dendrite.
The general structure of the dendrite is used to classify
neurons into multipolar, bipolar and unipolar types.
Multipolar neurons are composed of one axon and many
dendritic trees. Pyramidal cells are multipolar cortical
neurons with pyramid-shaped cell bodies and large dendrites
that extend towards the surface of the cortex (apical
dendrite). Bipolar neurons have two main dendrites at
opposing ends of the cell body. Many inhibitory neurons
have this morphology. Unipolar neurons, typical for insects,
have a stalk that extends from the cell body that separates
into two branches with one containing the dendrites and the
other with the terminal buttons. In vertebrates, sensory neurons detecting touch or temperature are
unipolar.[6][7][8] Dendritic branching can be extensive and in some cases is sufficient to receive as many as
100,000 inputs to a single neuron.[4]
The term dendrites was first used in 1889 by Wilhelm His to describe the number of smaller "protoplasmic
processes" that were attached to a nerve cell.[9] German anatomist Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters is generally
credited with the discovery of the axon by distinguishing it from the dendrites.
Some of the first intracellular recordings in a nervous system were made in the late 1930s by Kenneth S.
Cole and Howard J. Curtis. Swiss Rüdolf Albert von Kölliker and German Robert Remak were the first to
identify and characterize the axonal initial segment. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley also employed the
squid giant axon (1939) and by 1952 they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of
the action potential, leading the formulation of the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Hodgkin and Huxley were
awarded jointly the Nobel Prize for this work in 1963. The formulas detailing axonal conductance were
History
extended to vertebrates in the Frankenhaeuser–Huxley equations. Louis-Antoine Ranvier was the first to
describe the gaps or nodes found on axons and for this contribution these axonal features are now
commonly referred to as the Nodes of Ranvier. Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a Spanish anatomist, proposed that
axons were the output components of neurons.[10] He also proposed that neurons were discrete cells that
communicated with each other via specialized junctions, or spaces, between cells, now known as a synapse.
Ramón y Cajal improved a silver staining process known as Golgi's method, which had been developed by
his rival, Camillo Golgi.[11]
During the development of dendrites, several factors can
influence differentiation. These include modulation of
sensory input, environmental pollutants, body temperature,
and drug use.[12] For example, rats raised in dark
environments were found to have a reduced number of
spines in pyramidal cells located in the primary visual
cortex and a marked change in distribution of dendrite
branching in layer 4 stellate cells.[13] Experiments done in
vitro and in vivo have shown that the presence of afferents
and input activity per se can modulate the patterns in
which dendrites differentiate.[14]
Little is known about the process by which dendrites orient themselves in vivo and are compelled to create
the intricate branching pattern unique to each specific neuronal class. One theory on the mechanism of
dendritic arbor development is the Synaptotropic Hypothesis. The synaptotropic hypothesis proposes that
input from a presynaptic to a postsynaptic cell (and maturation of excitatory synaptic inputs) eventually can
change the course of synapse formation at dendritic and axonal arbors.[15]
This synapse formation is required for the development of neuronal structure in the functioning brain. A
balance between metabolic costs of dendritic elaboration and the need to cover receptive field presumably
determine the size and shape of dendrites. A complex array of extracellular and intracellular cues modulates
dendrite development including transcription factors, receptor-ligand interactions, various signaling
pathways, local translational machinery, cytoskeletal elements, Golgi outposts and endosomes. These
contribute to the organization of the dendrites on individual cell bodies and the placement of these dendrites
in the neuronal circuitry. For example, it was shown that β-actin zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1)
contributes to proper dendritic branching.
Other important transcription factors involved in the morphology of dendrites include CUT, Abrupt, Collier,
Spineless, ACJ6/drifter, CREST, NEUROD1, CREB, NEUROG2 etc. Secreted proteins and cell surface
receptors includes neurotrophins and tyrosine kinase receptors, BMP7, Wnt/dishevelled, EPHB 1–3,
Semaphorin/plexin-neuropilin, slit-robo, netrin-frazzled, reelin. Rac, CDC42 and RhoA serve as
cytoskeletal regulators and the motor protein includes KIF5, dynein, LIS1. Important secretory and
endocytic pathways controlling the dendritic development include DAR3 /SAR1, DAR2/Sec23,
Dendrite development
DAR6/Rab1 etc. All these molecules interplay with each other in controlling dendritic morphogenesis
including the acquisition of type specific dendritic arborization, the regulation of dendrite size and the
organization of dendrites emanating from different neurons.[1][16]
Dendritic arborization, also known as dendritic branching, is a multi-step biological process by which
neurons form new dendritic trees and branches to create new synapses.[1] Dendrites in many organisms
assume different morphological patterns of branching. The morphology of dendrites such as branch density
and grouping patterns are highly correlated to the function of the neuron. Malformation of dendrites is also
tightly correlated to impaired nervous system function.[14]
Branching morphologies may assume an adendritic structure (not having a branching structure, or not tree-
like), or a tree-like radiation structure. Tree-like arborization patterns can be spindled (where two dendrites
radiate from opposite poles of a cell body with few branches, see bipolar neurons ), spherical (where
dendrites radiate in a part or in all directions from a cell body, see cerebellar granule cells), laminar (where
dendrites can either radiate planarly, offset from cell body by one or more stems, or multi-planarly, see
retinal horizontal cells, retinal ganglion cells, retinal amacrine cells respectively), cylindrical (where
dendrites radiate in all directions in a cylinder, disk-like fashion, see pallidal neurons), conical (dendrites
radiate like a cone away from cell body, see pyramidal cells), or fanned (where dendrites radiate like a flat
fan as in Purkinje cells).
The structure and branching of a neuron's dendrites, as well as the availability and variation of voltage-
gated ion conductance, strongly influences how the neuron integrates the input from other neurons. This
integration is both temporal, involving the summation of stimuli that arrive in rapid succession, as well as
spatial, entailing the aggregation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from separate branches.[17]
Dendrites were once thought to merely convey electrical stimulation passively. This passive transmission
means that voltage changes measured at the cell body are the result of activation of distal synapses
propagating the electric signal towards the cell body without the aid of voltage-gated ion channels. Passive
cable theory describes how voltage changes at a particular location on a dendrite transmit this electrical
signal through a system of converging dendrite segments of different diameters, lengths, and electrical
properties. Based on passive cable theory one can track how changes in a neuron's dendritic morphology
impacts the membrane voltage at the cell body, and thus how variation in dendrite architectures affects the
overall output characteristics of the neuron.[18][19]
Action potentials initiated at the axon hillock propagate back into the dendritic arbor. These back-
propagating action potentials depolarize the dendritic membrane and provide a crucial signal for synapse
modulation and long-term potentiation. Back-propagation is not completely passive, but modulated by the
presence of dendritic voltage-gated potassium channels. Furthermore, in certain types of neurons, a train of
back-propagating action potentials can induce a calcium action potential (a dendritic spike) at dendritic
initiation zones.[20][21]
Types of dendritic patterns
Electrical properties
Plasticity
Dendrites themselves appear to be capable of plastic changes during the adult life of animals, including
invertebrates.[22] Neuronal dendrites have various compartments known as functional units that are able to
compute incoming stimuli. These functional units are involved in processing input and are composed of the
subdomains of dendrites such as spines, branches, or groupings of branches. Therefore, plasticity that leads
to changes in the dendrite structure will affect communication and processing in the cell. During
development, dendrite morphology is shaped by intrinsic programs within the cell's genome and extrinsic
factors such as signals from other cells. But in adult life, extrinsic signals become more influential and cause
more significant changes in dendrite structure compared to intrinsic signals during development. In females,
the dendritic structure can change as a result of physiological conditions induced by hormones during
periods such as pregnancy, lactation, and following the estrous cycle. This is particularly visible in
pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where the density of dendrites can vary up to
30%.[14]
Recent experimental observations suggest that adaptation is performed in the neuronal dendritic trees, where
the timescale of adaptation was observed to be as low as several seconds only.[23][24] Certain machine
learning architectures based on dendritic trees have shown to simplify the learning algorithm without
affecting performance.[25]
