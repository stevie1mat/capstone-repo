A neural pathway connects one part
of the nervous system to another
using bundles of axons called tracts.
The optic tract that extends from the
optic nerve is an example of a neural
pathway because it connects the eye
to the brain; additional pathways
within the brain connect to the visual
cortex.

Neural pathway
In neuroanatomy, a neural pathway is the connection formed by
axons that project from neurons to make synapses onto neurons in
another location, to enable neurotransmission (the sending of a
signal from one region of the nervous system to another). Neurons
are connected by a single axon, or by a bundle of axons known as a
nerve tract, or fasciculus.[1] Shorter neural pathways are found
within grey matter in the brain, whereas longer projections, made
up of myelinated axons, constitute white matter.
In the hippocampus, there are neural pathways involved in its
circuitry including the perforant pathway, that provides a
connectional route from the entorhinal cortex[2] to all fields of the
hippocampal formation, including the dentate gyrus, all CA fields
(including CA1),[3] and the subiculum.
Descending motor pathways of the pyramidal tracts travel from the
cerebral cortex to the brainstem or lower spinal cord.[4][5]
Ascending sensory tracts in the dorsal column–medial lemniscus
pathway (DCML) carry information from the periphery to the
cortex of the brain.
The first named pathways are evident to
the naked eye even in a poorly preserved
brain, and were named by the great
anatomists of the Renaissance using
cadaver material. Examples of these
include the great commissures of the brain
such as the corpus callosum (Latin, "hard body"; not to be confused with the Latin word "colossus" – the
"huge" statue), anterior commissure, and posterior commissure. Further examples include the pyramidal

tract, crus cerebri (Latin, "leg of the brain"), and cerebellar peduncles (Latin, "little foot of the cerebellum").
Note that these names describe the appearance of a structure but give no information on its function,
location, etc.
Later, as neuroanatomical knowledge became more sophisticated, the trend was toward naming pathways
by their origin and termination. For example, the nigrostriatal pathway runs from the substantia nigra (Latin,
"black substance") to the corpus striatum (Latin, "striped body"). This naming can extend to include any
number of structures in a pathway, such that the cerebellorubrothalamocortical pathway originates in the
cerebellum, synapses in the red nucleus ("ruber" in Latin), on to the thalamus, and finally terminating in the
cerebral cortex.
Sometimes, these two naming conventions coexist. For example, the name "pyramidal tract" has been
mainly supplanted by lateral corticospinal tract in most texts. Note that the "old" name was primarily
descriptive, evoking the pyramids of antiquity, from the appearance of this neural pathway in the medulla
oblongata. The "new" name is based primarily on its origin (in the primary motor cortex, Brodmann area 4)
and termination (onto the alpha motor neurons of the spinal cord).
In the cerebellum, one of the two major pathways is that of the mossy fibers. Mossy fibers project directly to
the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers
→ Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. The other main pathway is from the climbing fibers and these project to
Purkinje cells and also send collaterals directly to the deep nuclei.[6]
In general, neurons receive information either at their
dendrites or cell bodies. The axon of a nerve cell is, in
general, responsible for transmitting information over a
relatively long distance. Therefore, most neural
pathways are made up of axons. If the axons have
myelin sheaths, then the pathway appears bright white
because myelin is primarily lipid. If most or all of the
axons lack myelin sheaths (i.e., are unmyelinated), then
the pathway will appear a darker beige color, which is
generally called grey.
Some 
neurons 
are 
responsible 
for 
conveying
information over long distances. For example, motor
neurons, which travel from the spinal cord to the
muscle, can have axons up to a meter in length in humans. The longest axon in the human body belongs to
the Sciatic Nerve and runs from the great toe to the base of the spinal cord. These are archetypal examples
of neural pathways.
Neural pathways in the basal ganglia in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, are seen as
controlling different aspects of behaviour. This regulation is enabled by the dopamine pathways. It has been
proposed that the dopamine system of pathways is the overall organiser of the neural pathways that are seen
