Cranial nerves
Cranial nerves are the nerves that emerge directly from the brain
(including the brainstem), of which there are conventionally
considered twelve pairs. Cranial nerves relay information
between the brain and parts of the body, primarily to and from
regions of the head and neck, including the special senses of
vision, taste, smell, and hearing.[1]
The cranial nerves emerge from the central nervous system above
the level of the first vertebra of the vertebral column.[2] Each
cranial nerve is paired and is present on both sides. There are
conventionally twelve pairs of cranial nerves, which are
described with Roman numerals I–XII. Some considered there to
be thirteen pairs of cranial nerves, including cranial nerve zero.
The numbering of the cranial nerves is based on the order in
which they emerge from the brain and brainstem, from front to
back.[2]
The terminal nerves (0), olfactory nerves (I) and optic nerves (II)
emerge from the cerebrum, and the remaining ten pairs arise from
the brainstem, which is the lower part of the brain.[3]
The cranial nerves are considered components of the peripheral
nervous system (PNS),[3] although on a structural level the
olfactory (I), optic (II), and trigeminal (V) nerves are more
accurately considered part of the central nervous system
(CNS).[4]
The cranial nerves are in contrast to spinal nerves, which emerge
from segments of the spinal cord.[3]
Most typically, humans are considered to have twelve pairs of
cranial nerves (I–XII), with the terminal nerve (0) more recently
canonized.[2][5] The nerves are: the olfactory nerve (I), the optic
nerve (II), oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), trigeminal
nerve

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), glossopharyngeal nerve (IX),
vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI), and the hypoglossal
nerve (XII).
Cranial nerves are generally named according to their structure or
function. For example, the olfactory nerve (I) supplies smell, and
the facial nerve (VII) supplies the muscles of the face. Because
Latin was the lingua franca of the study of anatomy when the
nerves were first documented, recorded, and discussed, many
nerves maintain Latin or Greek names, including the trochlear
nerve (IV), named according to its structure, as it supplies a
muscle that attaches to a pulley (Greek: trochlea). The trigeminal
nerve (V) is named in accordance with its three components
(Latin: trigeminus meaning triplets),[6] and the vagus nerve (X) is
named for its wandering course (Latin: vagus).[7]
Cranial nerves are numbered based on their position from front to
back (rostral-caudal) of their position on the brain,[8] as, when
viewing the forebrain and brainstem from below, they are often
visible in their numeric order. For example, the olfactory nerves
(I) and optic nerves (II) arise from the base of the forebrain, and
the other nerves, III to XII, arise from the brainstem.[8]
Cranial nerves have paths within and outside the skull. The paths
within the skull are called "intracranial" and the paths outside the
skull are called "extracranial". There are many holes in the skull called "foramina" by which the nerves can
exit the skull. All cranial nerves are paired, which means they occur on both the right and left sides of the
body. The muscle, skin, or additional function supplied by a nerve, on the same side of the body as the side
it originates from, is an ipsilateral function. If the function is on the opposite side to the origin of the nerve,
this is known as a contralateral function.[9]
Grossly, all cranial nerves have a nucleus. With the exception of the olfactory nerve (I) and optic nerve (II),
all the nuclei are present in the brainstem.[2]
The midbrain has the nuclei of the oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV); the pons has the nuclei
of the trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII); and
the medulla has the nuclei of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and
hypoglossal nerve (XII).[10] The olfactory nerve (I) emerges from the olfactory bulb, and depending slightly
on division the optic nerve (II) is considered to emerge from the lateral geniculate nuclei.[10]

after the order in which they emerge
Because each nerve may have several functions, the nerve
fibres that make up the nerve may collect in more than one
nucleus. For example, the trigeminal nerve (V), which has a
sensory and a motor role, has at least four nuclei.[10][11]
With the exception of the olfactory nerve (I) and optic nerve
(II), the cranial nerves emerge from the brainstem. The
oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV) emerge from
the midbrain, the trigeminal (V), abducens (VI), facial (VII)
and vestibulocochlear (VIII) from the pons, and the
glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), accessory (XI) and
hypoglossal (XII) emerge from the medulla.[12]
The olfactory nerve (I) and optic nerve (II) emerge separately.
The olfactory nerves emerge from the olfactory bulbs on either
side of the crista galli, a bony projection below the frontal
lobe, and the optic nerves (II) emerge from the lateral
colliculus, swellings on either side of the temporal lobes of the
brain.[12]
The cranial nerves give rise to a number of ganglia, collections
of the cell bodies of neurons in the nerves that are outside of
the brain. These ganglia are both parasympathetic and sensory
ganglia.[10]
The sensory ganglia of the cranial nerves, directly correspond
to the dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves and are known as
cranial nerve ganglia.[8] Sensory ganglia exist for nerves with
sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X.[2] There are also a
number of parasympathetic cranial nerve ganglia. Sympathetic
ganglia supplying the head and neck reside in the upper
regions of the sympathetic trunk, and do not belong to the
cranial nerves.[10]
The ganglion of the sensory nerves, which are similar in
structure to the dorsal root ganglion of the spinal cord,
include:[13]
The trigeminal ganglia of the trigeminal nerve (V),
which occupies a space in the dura mater called
Meckel's cave. This ganglion contains only the
sensory fibres of the trigeminal nerve.
The geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve (VII),
which occurs just after the nerve enters the facial
canal.

Additional ganglia for nerves with parasympathetic function

(III), the pterygopalatine ganglion of the maxillary nerve (V2),
the submandibular ganglion of the lingual nerve, a branch of
the facial nerve (VII), and the otic ganglion of the
glossopharyngeal nerve (IX).[14]
After emerging from the brain, the cranial nerves travel within the skull, and some must leave it in order to
reach their destinations. Often the nerves pass through holes in the skull, called foramina, as they travel to
their destinations. Other nerves pass through bony canals, longer pathways enclosed by bone. These
foramina and canals may contain more than one cranial nerve and may also contain blood vessels.[13]
The terminal nerve (0), is a thin network of fibers associated with the dura and lamina
terminalis running rostral to the olfactory nerve, with projections through the cribriform plate.
The olfactory nerve (I), passes through perforations in the cribriform plate part of the ethmoid
bone. The nerve fibres end in the upper nasal cavity.
The optic nerve (II) passes through the optic foramen in the sphenoid bone as it travels to the
eye.
The oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), abducens nerve (VI) and the ophthalmic
branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) travel through the cavernous sinus into the superior
orbital fissure, passing out of the skull into the orbit.

nerves
The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (V2) passes through foramen rotundum in the
sphenoid bone.
The mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3) passes through foramen ovale of the
sphenoid bone.
The facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) both enter the internal auditory canal
in the temporal bone. The facial nerve then reaches the side of the face by using the
stylomastoid foramen, also in the temporal bone. Its fibers then spread out to reach and
control all of the muscles of facial expression. The vestibulocochlear nerve reaches the
organs that control balance and hearing in the temporal bone and therefore does not reach
the external surface of the skull.
The glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X) and accessory nerve (XI) all leave the skull via the
jugular foramen to enter the neck. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides sensation to the
upper throat and the back of the tongue, the vagus supplies the muscles in the larynx and
continues downward to supply parasympathetic supply to the chest and abdomen. The
accessory nerve controls the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles in the neck and
shoulder.
The hypoglossal nerve (XII) exits the skull using the
hypoglossal canal in the occipital bone.
The cranial nerves are formed from the contribution of two
specialized embryonic cell populations, cranial neural crest and
ectodermal placodes. The components of the sensory nervous
system of the head are derived from the neural crest and from an
embryonic cell population developing in close proximity, the cranial
sensory placodes (the olfactory, lens, otic, trigeminal, epibranchial and paratympanic placodes). The dual
origin cranial nerves are summarized in the following table:[15]

The cranial nerves provide motor and sensory supply mainly to the structures within the head and neck. The
sensory supply includes both "general" sensation such as temperature and touch, and "special" senses such
as taste, vision, smell, balance and hearing.[11] The vagus nerve (X) provides sensory and autonomic
(parasympathetic) supply to structures in the neck and also to most of the organs in the chest and
abdomen.[3][2]
The terminal nerve (0) may not have a role in humans,[3] although it has been implicated in hormonal
responses to smell, sexual response and mate selection.[5]
The olfactory nerve (I) conveys information giving rise to the sense of smell.[16]
Damage to the olfactory nerve (I) can cause an inability to smell (anosmia), a distortion in the sense of smell
(parosmia), or a distortion or lack of taste.[16][17]
The optic nerve (II) transmits visual information.[2]
Damage to the optic nerve (II) affects specific aspects of vision that depend on the location of the damage.
A person may not be able to see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have
difficulty seeing objects from their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is
involved. Inflammation (optic neuritis) may impact the sharpness of vision or colour detection[16]
The oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI) coordinate eye movement. The
oculomotor nerve (III) controls all muscles of the eye except for the superior oblique muscle controlled by
the trochlear nerve (IV), and the lateral rectus muscle controlled by the abducens nerve (VI). This means the
ability of the eye to look down and inwards is controlled by the trochlear nerve (IV), the ability to look
outwards is controlled by the abducens nerve (VI), and all other movements are controlled by the
oculomotor nerve (III)[16]
Damage to these nerves may affect the movement of the eye. Damage may result in double vision (diplopia)
because the movements of the eyes are not synchronized. Abnormalities of visual movement may also be
seen on examination, such as jittering (nystagmus).[17]

Terminal nerve (0)
Smell (I)
Vision (II)
Eye movement (III, IV, VI)
The oculomotor (III), troclear (IV) and
abducens (VI) nerves supply the
muscle of the eye. Damage will
affect the movement of the eye in
various ways, shown here.
Damage to the oculomotor nerve (III) can cause double vision and
inability to coordinate the movements of both eyes (strabismus),
also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis).[18]
Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis
of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion
to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to
alleviate symptoms due to paralysis of one or more of the eye
muscles it controls.[17]
Damage to the trochlear nerve (IV) can also cause double vision
with the eye adducted and elevated.[18] The result will be an eye
which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards
when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the
superior oblique muscle.[17]
Damage to the abducens nerve (VI) can also result in double
vision.[18] This is due to impairment in the lateral rectus muscle,
supplied by the abducens nerve.[17]
The trigeminal nerve (V) and its three main branches the
ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) provide sensation to the skin of the face and also
controls the muscles of chewing.[16]
Damage to the trigeminal nerve leads to loss of sensation in an affected area. Other conditions affecting the
trigeminal nerve (V) include trigeminal neuralgia, herpes zoster, sinusitis pain, presence of a dental abscess,
and cluster headaches.[19][16]
The facial nerve (VII) controls most muscles of facial expression, supplies the sensation of taste from the
front two-thirds of the tongue, and controls the stapedius muscle.[16] Most muscles are supplied by the
cortex on the opposite side of the brain; the exception is the frontalis muscle of the forehead, in which the
left and the right side of the muscle both receive inputs from both sides of the brain.[16]
Damage to the facial nerve (VII) may cause facial palsy. This is where a person is unable to move the
muscles on one or both sides of their face.[16] The most common cause of this is Bell's palsy, the ultimate
cause of which is unknown.[16] Patients with Bell's palsy often have a drooping mouth on the affected side
and often have trouble chewing because the buccinator muscle is affected.[3] The facial nerve is also the
most commonly affected cranial nerve in blunt trauma.[20]
The vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) supplies information relating to balance and hearing via its two
branches, the vestibular and cochlear nerves. The vestibular part is responsible for supplying sensation from
the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear, including information about balance, and is an

important component of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the
head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The
cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing
sound to be heard.[2]
When damaged, the vestibular nerve may give rise to the sensation
of spinning and dizziness (vertigo). Function of the vestibular nerve
may be tested by putting cold and warm water in the ears and
watching eye movements caloric stimulation.[3][17] Damage to the
vestibulocochlear nerve can also present as repetitive and
involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), particularly when the eye
is moving horizontally.[17] Damage to the cochlear nerve will cause
partial or complete deafness in the affected ear.[17]
The glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) supplies the stylopharyngeus
muscle and provides sensation to the oropharynx and back of the
tongue.[3] 
The 
glossopharyngeal 
nerve 
also 
provides
parasympathetic input to the parotid gland.[3]
Damage to the nerve may cause failure of the gag reflex; a failure
may also be seen in damage to the vagus nerve (X).[16]
The vagus nerve (X) provides sensory and parasympathetic supply to
structures in the neck and also to most of the organs in the chest and
abdomen.[2]
Loss of function of the vagus nerve (X) will lead to a loss of parasympathetic
supply to a very large number of structures. Major effects of damage to the
vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated
dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but – if the lesion is located above
the point at which the vagus first branches off – can be indicated by a hoarse
voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal
nerve.[10]
Damage to this nerve may result in difficulties swallowing.[17]
The accessory nerve (XI) supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.[16]
Damage to the accessory nerve (XI) will lead to weakness in the trapezius muscle on the same side as the
damage. The trapezius lifts the shoulder when shrugging, so the affected shoulder will not be able to shrug
and the shoulder blade (scapula) will protrude into a winged position.[3] Depending on the location of the

lesion there may also be weakness
present in the sternocleidomastoid
muscle, which acts to turn the head so
that the face points to the opposite
side.[16]
The hypoglossal nerve (XII) supplies
the intrinsic muscles of the tongue,
controlling tongue movement.[16] The
hypoglossal nerve (XII) is unique in
that it is supplied by the motor
cortices of both hemispheres of the
brain.[17]
Damage to the nerve may lead to
fasciculations or wasting (atrophy) of
the muscles of the tongue. This will

to

When
damaged and extended, the tongue
will move towards the weaker or
damaged side, as shown in the image.[17] The fasciculations of the tongue are sometimes said to look like a
"bag of worms". Damage to the nerve tract or nucleus will not lead to atrophy or fasciculations, but only
weakness of the muscles on the same side as the damage.[17]
Doctors, neurologists and other medical professionals may conduct a cranial nerve examination as part of a
neurological examination to examine the cranial nerves. This is a highly formalised series of steps involving
specific tests for each nerve.[16] Dysfunction of a nerve identified during testing may point to a problem
with the nerve or of a part of the brain.[16]
A cranial nerve exam starts with observation of the patient, as some cranial nerve lesions may affect the
symmetry of the eyes or face.[16] Vision may be tested by examining the visual fields, or by examining the
retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to
pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.[17] Eye movement is
tested and abnormalities such as nystagmus are observed for. The sensation of the face is tested, and patients
are asked to perform different facial movements, such as puffing out of the cheeks. Hearing is checked by
voice and tuning forks. The patient's uvula is examined. After performing a shrug and head turn, the
patient's tongue function is assessed by various tongue movements.[16]
Tongue movement (XII)
Clinical significance
Examination
Smell is not routinely tested, but if there is suspicion of a change in the sense of smell, each nostril is tested
with substances of known odors such as coffee or soap. Intensely smelling substances, for example
ammonia, may lead to the activation of pain receptors of the trigeminal nerve (V) located in the nasal cavity
and this can confound olfactory testing.[16][17]
Nerves may be compressed because of increased intracranial pressure, a mass effect of an intracerebral
haemorrhage, or tumour that presses against the nerves and interferes with the transmission of impulses
along the nerve.[22] Loss of function of a cranial nerve may sometimes be the first symptom of an
intracranial or skull base cancer.[23]
An increase in intracranial pressure may lead to impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of
the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema).[24] A cancer, such as
an optic nerve glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts
or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend
into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve
(VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the
temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.[22]
The cause of trigeminal neuralgia, in which one side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be
compression of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem.[22] An acoustic neuroma,
particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and
vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.[22][25]
Occlusion of blood vessels that supply the nerves or their nuclei, an ischemic stroke, may cause specific
signs and symptoms relating to the damaged area. If there is a stroke of the midbrain, pons or medulla,
various cranial nerves may be damaged, resulting in dysfunction and symptoms of a number of different
syndromes.[26] Thrombosis, such as a cavernous sinus thrombosis, refers to a clot (thrombus) affecting the
venous drainage from the cavernous sinus, affects the optic (II), oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), ophthalmic
branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) and the abducens nerve (VI).[25]
Inflammation of a cranial nerve can occur as a result of infection, such as viral causes like reactivated herpes
simplex virus, or can occur spontaneously. Inflammation of the facial nerve (VII) may result in Bell's
palsy.[27]

The accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII) cannot be seen, as they are not always present in all
vertebrates.
Multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory process resulting in a loss of the myelin sheathes which surround the
cranial nerves, may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves. Inflammation
may also affect other cranial nerves.[27] Other rarer inflammatory causes affecting the function of multiple
cranial nerves include sarcoidosis, miliary tuberculosis, and inflammation of arteries, such as granulomatosis
with polyangiitis.[25]
Trauma to the skull, disease of bone, such as Paget's disease, and injury to nerves during surgery are other
causes of nerve damage.[25]
The Graeco-Roman anatomist Galen (AD 129–210) named seven pairs of cranial nerves.[7] Much later, in
1664, English anatomist Sir Thomas Willis suggested that there were actually 9 pairs of nerves. Finally, in
1778, German anatomist Samuel Soemmering named the 12 pairs of nerves that are generally accepted
today.[7] However, because many of the nerves emerge from the brain stem as rootlets, there is continual
debate as to how many nerves there actually are, and how they should be grouped.[7] For example, there is
reason to consider both the olfactory (I) and optic (II) nerves to be brain tracts, rather than cranial nerves.[7]

History
Other animals
Cranial nerves are also present in other vertebrates. Other amniotes (non-amphibian tetrapods) have cranial
nerves similar to those of humans. In anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), the accessory nerve (XI) and
hypoglossal nerve (XII) do not exist, with the accessory nerve (XI) being an integral part of the vagus nerve
(X); the hypoglossal nerve (XII) is represented by a variable number of spinal nerves emerging from
vertebral segments fused into the occiput. These two nerves only became discrete nerves in the ancestors of
amniotes.[28] The very small terminal nerve (nerve N or O) exists in humans but may not be functional. In
other animals, it appears to be important to sexual receptivity based on perceptions of pheromones.[3][29]
