Myelin
Myelin (/ˈmaɪ.əlɪn/ MY-ə-lin) is a lipid-rich material that surrounds
nerve cell axons (the nervous system's electrical wires) to insulate
them and increase the rate at which electrical impulses (called action
potentials) pass along the axon.[1][2] The myelinated axon can be
likened to an electrical wire (the axon) with insulating material
(myelin) around it. However, unlike the plastic covering on an
electrical wire, myelin does not form a single long sheath over the
entire length of the axon. Rather, myelin ensheaths the axon
segmentally: in general, each axon is encased in multiple long
sheaths with short gaps between, called nodes of Ranvier. At
the nodes of Ranvier, which are approximately one thousandth
of a mm in length, the axon's membrane is bare of myelin.
Myelin's best known function is to increase the rate at which
information, encoded as electrical charges, passes along the
axon's length. Myelin achieves this by eliciting saltatory
conduction,.[1] Saltatory conduction refers to the fact that
electrical impulses 'jump' along the axon, over long myelin
sheaths, from one node of Ranvier to the next. Thus,
information is passed around 100 times faster along a
myelinated axon than a non-myelinated one.
At the molecular level, the myelin sheath increases the distance
between extracellular and intracellular ions, reducing the
accumulation of electrical charges. The discontinuous structure
of the myelin sheath results in the action potential "jumping"
from one node of Ranvier over a long (c. 0.1 mm – >1 mm, or
100-1000  micron) myelinated stretch of the axon called the
internodal segment or "internode", before "recharging" at the
next node of Ranvier. This 'jumping' continues until the action
potential reaches the axon terminal.[3][4][5] Once there, the
electrical 
signal 
provokes 
the 
release 
of 
chemical
neurotransmitters across the synapse, which bind to receptors
on the post-synaptic cell (e.g. another neuron, myocyte or
secretory cell).
Myelin is made by glial cells, which are non-neuronal cells that
provide nutritional and homeostatic support to the axons. This
is because axons, being elongated structures, are too far from
the soma to be supported by the neurons themselves. In the
central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerves),
myelination is formed by specialized glial cells called

Anatomical terminology
oligodendrocytes, each of which sends out processes (limb-like
extensions from the cell body) to myelinate multiple nearby
axons; while in the peripheral nervous system, myelin is formed
by neurolemmocytes (Schwann cells), which only myelinate a
section of one axon. In the CNS, axons carry electrical signals from one nerve cell body to another.[6][7]
The "insulating" function for myelin is essential for efficient motor function (i.e. movement such as
walking), sensory function (e.g. sight, hearing, smell, the feeling of touch or pain) and cognition (e.g.
acquiring and recalling knowledge), as demonstrated by the consequence of disorders that affect
myelination, such as the genetically determined leukodystrophies;[8] the acquired inflammatory
demyelinating 
disorder, 
multiple 
sclerosis;[9] 
and 
the 
inflammatory 
demyelinating 
peripheral
neuropathies.[10] Due to its high prevalence, multiple sclerosis, which specifically affects the central
nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerve), is the best known disorder of myelin.
The process of generating myelin is called myelination or myelinogenesis. In the CNS, oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells (OPCs) differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, which form myelin. In humans,
myelination begins early in the 3rd trimester,[11] although only little myelin is present in either the CNS or
the PNS at the time of birth. During infancy, myelination progresses rapidly, with increasing numbers of
axons acquiring myelin sheaths. This corresponds with the development of cognitive and motor skills,
including language comprehension, speech acquisition, crawling and walking. Myelination continues
through adolescence and early adulthood and although largely complete at this time, myelin sheaths can be
added in grey matter regions such as the cerebral cortex, throughout life.[12][13][14]
Myelin is considered a defining characteristic of the jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), though axons are
ensheathed by a type of cell, called glial cells, in invertebrates.[15][16] These glial wraps are quite different
from vertebrate compact myelin, formed, as indicated above, by concentric wrapping of the myelinating cell
process multiple times around the axon. Myelin was first described in 1854 by Rudolf Virchow,[17]
although it was over a century later, following the development of electron microscopy, that its glial cell
origin and its ultrastructure became apparent.[18]
In vertebrates, not all axons are myelinated. For example, in the PNS, a large proportion of axons are
unmyelinated. Instead, they are ensheathed by non-myelinating Schwann cells known as Remak SCs and
arranged in Remak bundles.[19] In the CNS, non-myelinated axons (or intermittently myelinated axons,
meaning axons with long non-myelinated regions between myelinated segments) intermingle with
myelinated ones and are entwined, at least partially, by the processes of another type of glial cell the
astrocyte.[20]
Functionally equivalent myelin-like sheaths are found in several invertebrate taxa, including oligochaete
annelids, and crustacean taxa such as penaeids, palaemonids, and calanoids. These myelin-like sheaths
share several structural features with the sheaths found in vertebrates including multiplicity of membranes,

condensation of membrane, and nodes.[15] However, the nodes in vertebrates are annular; i.e. they encircle
the axon. In contrast, nodes found in the sheaths of invertebrates are either annular or fenestrated; i.e. they
are restricted to "spots". The fastest recorded conduction speed (across both vertebrates and invertebrates) is
found in the ensheathed axons of the Kuruma shrimp, an invertebrate,[15] ranging between 90 and
200 m/s[16] (cf. 100–120 m/s for the fastest myelinated vertebrate axon).
CNS myelin differs slightly in composition and configuration from
PNS myelin, but both perform the same "insulating" function (see
above). Being rich in lipid, myelin appears white, hence the name
given to the "white matter" of the CNS. Both CNS white matter
tracts (e.g. the optic nerve, corticospinal tract and corpus callosum)
and PNS nerves (e.g. the sciatic nerve and the auditory nerve,
which also appear white) each comprise thousands to millions of
axons, largely aligned in parallel. Blood vessels provide the route
for oxygen and energy substrates such as glucose to reach these
fibre tracts, which also contain other cell types including astrocytes
and microglia in the CNS and macrophages in the PNS.
In terms of total mass, myelin comprises approximately 40% water;
the dry mass comprises between 60% and 75% lipid and between
15% and 25% protein. Protein content includes myelin basic protein
(MBP),[21] which is abundant in the CNS where it plays a critical,
non-redundant role in formation of compact myelin; myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG),[22] which is specific to the CNS; and
proteolipid protein (PLP),[23] which is the most abundant protein in CNS
myelin, but only a minor component of PNS myelin. In the PNS, myelin
protein zero (MPZ or P0) has a similar role to that of PLP in the CNS in
that it is involved in holding together the multiple concentric layers of glial
cell membrane that constitute the myelin sheath. The primary lipid of
myelin is a glycolipid called galactocerebroside. The intertwining
hydrocarbon chains of sphingomyelin strengthen the myelin sheath.
Cholesterol is an essential lipid component of myelin, without which myelin
fails to form.[24]
The main purpose of myelin is to increase the speed at which electrical
impulses (known as action potentials) propagate along the myelinated fiber.
In unmyelinated fibers, action potentials travel as continuous waves, but, in
myelinated fibers, they "hop" or propagate by saltatory conduction. The
latter is markedly faster than the former, at least for axons over a certain
diameter. Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance
across the axonal membrane (the axolemma). It has been suggested that
myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication
between distant body parts.[15]
Composition
Function
Action potential propagation in
myelinated neurons is faster than in
unmyelinated neurons because of
saltatory conduction.
Myelinated fibers lack voltage-gated sodium channels along the
myelinated internodes, exposing them only at the nodes of Ranvier.
Here, they are highly abundant and densely packed.[25] Positively
charged sodium ions can enter the axon through these voltage-gated
channels, leading to depolarisation of the membrane potential at the
node of Ranvier. The resting membrane potential is then rapidly
restored due to positively charged potassium ions leaving the axon
through potassium channels. The sodium ions inside the axon then
diffuse rapidly through the axoplasm (axonal cytoplasm), to the
adjacent myelinated internode and ultimately to the next (distal)
node of Ranvier, triggering the opening of the voltage gated sodium
channels and entry of sodium ions at this site. Although the sodium
ions diffuse through the axoplasm rapidly, diffusion is decremental
by nature, thus nodes of Ranvier have to be (relatively) closely
spaced, to secure action potential propagation.[26] The action
potential "recharges" at consecutive nodes of Ranvier as the
axolemmal membrane potential depolarises to approximately +35 mV.[25] Along the myelinated internode,
energy-dependent sodium/potassium pumps pump the sodium ions back out of the axon and potassium ions
back into the axon to restore the balance of ions between the intracellular (inside the cell, i.e. axon in this
case) and extracellular (outside the cell) fluids.
Whilst the role of myelin as an "axonal insulator" is well-established, other functions of myelinating cells
are less well known or only recently established. The myelinating cell "sculpts" the underlying axon by
promoting the phosphorylation of neurofilaments, thus increasing the diameter or thickness of the axon at
the internodal regions; helps cluster molecules on the axolemma (such as voltage-gated sodium channels) at
the node of Ranvier;[27] and modulates the transport of cytoskeletal structures and organelles such as
mitochondria, along the axon.[28] In 2012, evidence came to light to support a role for the myelinating cell
in "feeding" the axon.[29][30] In other words, the myelinating cell seems to act as a local "fueling station"
for the axon, which uses a great deal of energy to restore the normal balance of ions between it and its
environment,[31][32] following the generation of action potentials.
When a peripheral fiber is severed, the myelin sheath provides a track along which regrowth can occur.
However, the myelin layer does not ensure a perfect regeneration of the nerve fiber. Some regenerated
nerve fibers do not find the correct muscle fibers, and some damaged motor neurons of the peripheral
nervous system die without regrowth. Damage to the myelin sheath and nerve fiber is often associated with
increased functional insufficiency.
Unmyelinated fibers and myelinated axons of the mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate.[33]
Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves, and is the hallmark of some
neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,
neuromyelitis optica, transverse myelitis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain–
Barré syndrome, central pontine myelinosis, inherited demyelinating diseases such as leukodystrophy, and
Clinical significance
Demyelination
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. People with pernicious anaemia can also develop nerve damage if the
condition is not diagnosed quickly. Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord secondary to pernicious
anaemia can lead to slight peripheral nerve damage to severe damage to the central nervous system,
affecting speech, balance, and cognitive awareness. When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the
nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. A more serious case of myelin deterioration
is called Canavan disease.
The immune system may play a role in demyelination associated with such diseases, including inflammation
causing demyelination by overproduction of cytokines via upregulation of tumor necrosis factor[34] or
interferon. MRI evidence that docosahexaenoic acid DHA ethyl ester improves myelination in generalized
peroxisomal disorders.[35]
Demyelination results in diverse symptoms determined by the functions of the affected neurons. It disrupts
signals between the brain and other parts of the body; symptoms differ from patient to patient, and have
different presentations upon clinical observation and in laboratory studies.
Typical symptoms include blurriness in the central visual field that affects only one eye, may be
accompanied by pain upon eye movement, double vision, loss of vision/hearing, odd sensation in legs,
arms, chest, or face, such as tingling or numbness (neuropathy), weakness of arms or legs, cognitive
disruption, including speech impairment and memory loss, heat sensitivity (symptoms worsen or reappear
upon exposure to heat, such as a hot shower), loss of dexterity, difficulty coordinating movement or balance
disorder, difficulty controlling bowel movements or urination, fatigue, and tinnitus.[36]
Research to repair damaged myelin sheaths is ongoing. Techniques include surgically implanting
oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the central nervous system and inducing myelin repair with certain
antibodies. While results in mice have been encouraging (via stem cell transplantation), whether this
technique can be effective in replacing myelin loss in humans is still unknown.[37] Cholinergic treatments,
such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), may have beneficial effects on myelination, myelin repair,
and myelin integrity. Increasing cholinergic stimulation also may act through subtle trophic effects on brain
developmental processes and particularly on oligodendrocytes and the lifelong myelination process they
support. Increasing oligodendrocyte cholinergic stimulation, AChEIs, and other cholinergic treatments, such
as nicotine, possibly could promote myelination during development and myelin repair in older age.[38]
Glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitors such as lithium chloride have been found to promote myelination in
mice with damaged facial nerves.[39] Cholesterol is a necessary nutrient for the myelin sheath, along with
vitamin B12.[40][41]
Symptoms
Myelin repair
Dysmyelination
Dysmyelination is characterized by a defective structure and function of myelin sheaths; unlike
demyelination, it does not produce lesions. Such defective sheaths often arise from genetic mutations
affecting the biosynthesis and formation of myelin. The shiverer mouse represents one animal model of
dysmyelination. Human diseases where dysmyelination has been implicated include leukodystrophies
(Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease, Canavan disease, phenylketonuria) and schizophrenia.[42][43][44]
