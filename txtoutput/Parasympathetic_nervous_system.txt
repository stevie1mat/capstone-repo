Parasympathetic nervous system
The parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) is one of the
three divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the others
being the sympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous
system.[1][2] The enteric nervous system is sometimes
considered part of the autonomic nervous system, and
sometimes considered an independent system.[3]
The autonomic nervous system is responsible for regulating the
body's unconscious actions. The parasympathetic system is
responsible for stimulation of "rest-and-digest" or "feed-and-
breed"[4] activities that occur when the body is at rest,
especially after eating, including sexual arousal, salivation,
lacrimation (tears), urination, digestion, and defecation. Its
action is described as being complementary to that of the
sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for
stimulating activities associated with the fight-or-flight
response.
Nerve fibres of the parasympathetic nervous system arise from
the central nervous system. Specific nerves include several
cranial nerves, specifically the oculomotor nerve, facial nerve,
glossopharyngeal nerve, and vagus nerve. Three spinal nerves
in the sacrum (S2–4), commonly referred to as the pelvic
splanchnic nerves, also act as parasympathetic nerves.
Owing to its location, the parasympathetic system is commonly
referred to as having "craniosacral outflow", which stands in
contrast to the sympathetic nervous system, which is said to
have "thoracolumbar outflow".[5]
The parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral

branches

system 
(PNS).
Parasympathetic nerve supply arises through three primary
areas:
1. Certain cranial nerves in the cranium, namely the
preganglionic parasympathetic nerves (CN III, CN
VII, CN IX and CN X) usually arise from specific
nuclei in the central nervous system (CNS) and
synapse at one of four parasympathetic ganglia:
ciliary, pterygopalatine, otic, or submandibular. From
these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves

Anatomical terminology
complete their journey to target tissues via trigeminal
branches (ophthalmic nerve, maxillary nerve,
mandibular nerve).
2. The vagus nerve (CN X) does not participate in
these cranial ganglia as most of its parasympathetic
fibers are destined for a broad array of ganglia on or
near thoracic viscera (esophagus, trachea, heart,
lungs) and abdominal viscera (stomach, pancreas,
liver, kidneys, small intestine, and about half of the
large intestine). The vagus innervation ends at the
junction between the midgut and hindgut, just before
the splenic flexure of the transverse colon.
3. The pelvic splanchnic efferent preganglionic nerve
cell bodies reside in the lateral gray horn of the spinal cord at the T12–L1 vertebral levels
(the spinal cord terminates at the L1–L2 vertebrae with the conus medullaris), and their
axons exit the vertebral column as S2–S4 spinal nerves through the sacral foramina.[8] Their
axons continue away from the CNS to synapse at an autonomic ganglion. The
parasympathetic ganglion where these preganglionic neurons synapse will be close to the
organ of innervation. This differs from the sympathetic nervous system, where synapses
between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther
away from the target organ.
As in the sympathetic nervous system, efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central
nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons. The first neuron in this pathway is referred to as
the preganglionic or presynaptic neuron. Its cell body sits in the central nervous system and its axon usually
extends to synapse with the dendrites of a postganglionic neuron somewhere else in the body. The axons of
presynaptic parasympathetic neurons are usually long, extending from the CNS into a ganglion that is either
very close to or embedded in their target organ. As a result, the postsynaptic parasympathetic nerve fibers
are very short.[9]: 
42 
The oculomotor nerve is responsible for a number of parasympathetic functions related to the eye.[10] The
oculomotor PNS fibers originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus in the central nervous system and travel
through the superior orbital fissure to synapse in the ciliary ganglion located just behind the orbit (eye).[11]
From the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers, a
continuation of the nasociliary nerve (a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1)).
The short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle (responsible for accommodation)
and the iris sphincter muscle, which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil (in response to light
or accommodation). There are two motors that are part of the oculomotor nerve known as the somatic motor
and visceral motor. The somatic motor is responsible for moving the eye in precise motions and for keeping
the eye fixated on an object. The visceral motor helps constrict the pupil.[12]
The parasympathetic aspect of the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular
salivary glands, the lacrimal gland, and the glands associated with the nasal cavity. The preganglionic fibers
originate within the CNS in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve (which some
consider a separate cranial nerve altogether) to connect with the facial nerve just distal (further out) to it
surfacing the central nervous system. Just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion (general sensory
ganglion) in the temporal bone, the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves. The first is
the greater petrosal nerve and the second is the chorda tympani. The greater petrosal nerve travels through
Cranial nerves
the middle ear and eventually combines with the deep petrosal nerve (sympathetic fibers) to form the nerve
of the pterygoid canal. The parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the
pterygopalatine ganglion, which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve
(CN V2). The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the pterygopalatine ganglion in several
directions. One division leaves on the zygomatic division of CN V2 and travels on a communicating branch
to unite with the lacrimal nerve (branch of the ophthalmic nerve of CN V1) before synapsing at the lacrimal
gland. These parasympathetic to the lacrimal gland control tear production.[13]
A separate group of parasympathetic leaving from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the descending palatine
nerves (CN V2 branch), which include the greater and lesser palatine nerves. The greater palatine
parasympathetic synapse on the hard palate and regulate mucus glands located there. The lesser palatine
nerve synapses at the soft palate and controls sparse taste receptors and mucus glands. Yet another set of
divisions from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the posterior, superior, and inferior lateral nasal nerves; and
the nasopalatine nerves (all branches of CN V2, maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve) that bring
parasympathetic innervation to glands of the nasal mucosa. The second parasympathetic branch that leaves
the facial nerve is the chorda tympani. This nerve carries secretomotor fibers to the submandibular and
sublingual glands. The chorda tympani travels through the middle ear and attaches to the lingual nerve
(mandibular division of trigeminal, CN V3). After joining the lingual nerve, the preganglionic fibers
synapse at the submandibular ganglion and send postganglionic fibers to the sublingual and submandibular
salivary glands.
The glossopharyngeal nerve has parasympathetic fibers that innervate the parotid salivary gland. The
preganglionic fibers depart CN IX as the tympanic nerve and continue to the middle ear where they make
up a tympanic plexus on the cochlear promontory of the mesotympanum. The tympanic plexus of nerves
rejoin and form the lesser petrosal nerve and exit through the foramen ovale to synapse at the otic ganglion.
From the otic ganglion postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel with the auriculotemporal nerve
(mandibular branch of trigeminal, CN V3) to the parotid salivary gland.
The vagus nerve, named after the Latin word vagus (because the nerve controls such a broad range of target
tissues – vagus in Latin literally means "wandering"), has parasympathetic functions that originate in the
dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus ambiguus in the CNS. The vagus nerve is an unusual
cranial parasympathetic in that it does not join the trigeminal nerve in order to get to its target tissues.
Another peculiarity is that the vagus has an autonomic ganglion associated with it at approximately the level
of C1 vertebra. The vagus gives no parasympathetic to the cranium. The vagus nerve is hard to track
definitively due to its ubiquitous nature in the thorax and abdomen so the major contributions will be
discussed. Several parasympathetic nerves come off the vagus nerve as it enters the thorax. One nerve is the
recurrent laryngeal nerve, which becomes the inferior laryngeal nerve. From the left vagus nerve the
recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the aorta to travel back up to the larynx and proximal esophagus
while, from the right vagus nerve, the recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the right subclavian artery to
travel back up to the same location as its counterpart. These different paths are a direct result of
embryological development of the circulatory system. Each recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies the trachea
and the esophagus with parasympathetic secretomotor innervation for glands associated with them (and
other fibers that are not PN).
Vagus nerve
Another nerve that comes off the vagus nerves approximately at the level of entering the thorax are the
cardiac nerves. These cardiac nerves go on to form cardiac and pulmonary plexuses around the heart and
lungs. As the main vagus nerves continue into the thorax they become intimately linked with the esophagus
and sympathetic nerves from the sympathetic trunks to form the esophageal plexus. This is very efficient as
the major function of the vagus nerve from there on will be control of the gut smooth muscles and glands.
As the esophageal plexus enter the abdomen through the esophageal hiatus anterior and posterior vagus
trunks form. The vagus trunks then join with preaortic sympathetic ganglion around the aorta to disperse
with the blood vessels and sympathetic nerves throughout the abdomen. The extent of the parasympathetic
in the abdomen include the pancreas, kidneys, liver, gall bladder, stomach and gut tube. The vagus
contribution of parasympathetic continues down the gut tube until the end of the midgut. The midgut ends
two thirds of the way across the transverse colon near the splenic flexure.[14]
The pelvic splanchnic nerves, S2–4, work in tandem to innervate the pelvic viscera. Unlike in the cranium,
where one parasympathetic is in charge of one particular tissue or region, for the most part the pelvic
splanchnics each contribute fibers to pelvic viscera by traveling to one or more plexuses before being
dispersed to the target tissue. These plexuses are composed of mixed autonomic nerve fibers
(parasympathetic and sympathetic) and include the vesical, prostatic, rectal, uterovaginal, and inferior
hypogastric plexuses. The preganglionic neurons in the pathway do not synapse in a ganglion as in the
cranium but rather in the walls of the tissues or organs that they innervate. The fiber paths are variable and
each individual's autonomic nervous system in the pelvis is unique. The visceral tissues in the pelvis that the
parasympathetic nerve pathway controls include those of the urinary bladder, ureters, urinary sphincter, anal
sphincter, uterus, prostate, glands, vagina, and penis. Unconsciously, the parasympathetic will cause
peristaltic movements of the ureters and intestines, moving urine from the kidneys into the bladder and food
down the intestinal tract and, upon necessity, the parasympathetic will assist in excreting urine from the
bladder or defecation. Stimulation of the parasympathetic will cause the detrusor muscle (urinary bladder
wall) to contract and simultaneously relax the internal sphincter muscle between the bladder and the urethra,
allowing the bladder to void. Also, parasympathetic stimulation of the internal anal sphincter will relax this
muscle to allow defecation. There are other skeletal muscles involved with these processes but the
parasympathetic plays a huge role in continence and bowel retention.
A study published in 2016, suggests that all sacral autonomic output may be sympathetic; indicating that the
rectum, bladder and reproductive organs may only be innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. This
suggestion is based on detailed analysis of 15 phenotypic and ontogenetic factors differentiating
sympathetic from parasympathetic neurons in the mouse. Assuming that the reported findings most likely
applies to other mammals as well, this perspective suggests a simplified, bipartite architecture of the
autonomic nervous system, in which the parasympathetic nervous system receives input from cranial nerves
exclusively and the sympathetic nervous system from thoracic to sacral spinal nerves.[15]

The afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system, which transmit sensory information from the internal
organs of the body back to the central nervous system, are not divided into parasympathetic and
sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are.[9]: 
34–35  Instead, autonomic sensory information is conducted
by general visceral afferent fibers.
General visceral afferent sensations are mostly unconscious visceral motor reflex sensations from hollow
organs and glands that are transmitted to the CNS. While the unconscious reflex arcs normally are
undetectable, in certain instances they may send pain sensations to the CNS masked as referred pain. If the
Function
Sensation
peritoneal cavity becomes inflamed or if the bowel is suddenly distended, the body will interpret the afferent
pain stimulus as somatic in origin. This pain is usually non-localized. The pain is also usually referred to
dermatomes that are at the same spinal nerve level as the visceral afferent synapse.
Heart rate is largely controlled by the heart's internal pacemaker activity. Considering a healthy heart, the
main pacemaker is a collection of cells on the border of the atria and vena cava called the sinoatrial node.
Heart cells have the ability to generate electrical activity independent of external stimulation. As a result, the
cells of the node spontaneously generate electrical activity that is subsequently conducted throughout the
heart, resulting in a regular heart rate.
In absence of any external stimuli, sinoatrial pacing contributes to maintain the heart rate in the range of 60-
100 beats per minute (bpm).[17] At the same time, the two branches of the autonomic nervous system act in
a complementary way increasing or slowing the heart rate. In this context, the vagus nerve acts on sinoatrial
node slowing its conduction thus actively modulating vagal tone accordingly. This modulation is mediated
by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and downstream changes to ionic currents and calcium of heart
cells.[18]
The vagus nerve plays a crucial role in heart rate regulation by modulating the response of sinoatrial node;
vagal tone can be quantified by investigating heart rate modulation induced by vagal tone changes. As a
general consideration, increased vagal tone (and thus vagal action) is associated with a diminished and more
variable heart rate.[19][20] The main mechanism by which the parasympathetic nervous system acts on
vascular and cardiac control is the so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA is described as the
physiological and rhythmical fluctuation of heart rate at the respiration frequency, characterized by heart rate
increase during inspiration and decrease during expiration.
Another role that the parasympathetic nervous system plays is in sexual activity. In males, the cavernous
nerves from the prostatic plexus stimulate smooth muscles in the fibrous trabeculae of the coiled helicine
arteries of penis to relax and allow blood to fill the two corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum of the
penis, making it rigid to prepare for sexual activity. Upon emission of ejaculate, the sympathetics participate
and cause peristalsis of the ductus deferens and closure of the internal urethral sphincter to prevent semen
from entering the bladder. At the same time, parasympathetics cause peristalsis of the urethral muscle, and
the pudendal nerve causes contraction of the bulbospongiosus (skeletal muscle is not via PN), to forcibly
emit the semen. During remission the penis becomes flaccid again. In the female, there is erectile tissue
analogous to the male yet less substantial that plays a large role in sexual stimulation. The PN cause release
of secretions in the female that decrease friction. Also in the female, the parasympathetics innervate the
fallopian tubes, which helps peristaltic contractions and movement of the oocyte to the uterus for
implantation. The secretions from the female genital tract aid in sperm migration. The PN (and SN to a
lesser extent) play a significant role in reproduction.[9]
Vascular effects
Sexual activity
Receptors
The parasympathetic nervous system uses chiefly acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter, although
peptides (such as cholecystokinin) can be used.[21][22] The ACh acts on two types of receptors, the
muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Most transmissions occur in two stages: When stimulated,
the preganglionic neuron releases ACh at the ganglion, which acts on nicotinic receptors of postganglionic
neurons. The postganglionic neuron then releases ACh to stimulate the muscarinic receptors of the target
organ.
The five main types of muscarinic receptors:
The M1 muscarinic receptors (CHRM1 (https://www.genenames.org/tools/search/#!/genes?q
uery=CHRM1)) are located in the neural system.
The M2 muscarinic receptors (CHRM2 (https://www.genenames.org/tools/search/#!/genes?q
uery=CHRM2)) are located in the heart, and act to bring the heart back to normal after the
actions of the sympathetic nervous system: slowing down the heart rate, reducing contractile
forces of the atrial cardiac muscle, and reducing conduction velocity of the sinoatrial node
and atrioventricular node. They have a minimal effect on the contractile forces of the
ventricular muscle due to sparse innervation of the ventricles from the parasympathetic
nervous system.
The M3 muscarinic receptors (CHRM3 (https://www.genenames.org/tools/search/#!/genes?q
uery=CHRM3)) are located at many places in the body, such as the endothelial cells of blood
vessels, as well as the lungs causing bronchoconstriction. The net effect of innervated M3
receptors on blood vessels is vasodilation, as acetylcholine causes endothelial cells to
produce nitric oxide, which diffuses to smooth muscle and results in vasodilation. They are
also in the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, which help in increasing intestinal
motility and dilating sphincters. The M3 receptors are also located in many glands that help
to stimulate secretion in salivary glands and other glands of the body. They are also located
on the detrusor muscle and urothelium of the bladder, causing contraction.[23]
The M4 muscarinic receptors: Postganglionic cholinergic nerves, possible CNS effects
The M5 muscarinic receptors: Possible effects on the CNS
In vertebrates, nicotinic receptors are broadly classified into two subtypes based on their primary sites of
expression: muscle-type nicotinic receptors (N1) primarily for somatic motor neurons; and neuronal-type
nicotinic receptors (N2) primarily for autonomic nervous system.[24]
Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to each other. The sympathetic
division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses. The parasympathetic division functions
with actions that do not require immediate reaction. A mnemonic to summarize the functions of the
parasympathetic nervous system is SSLUDD (sexual arousal, salivation, lacrimation, urination, digestion
and defecation).

Relationship to sympathetic nervous system
Clinical significance
The functions promoted by activity in the parasympathetic nervous system are associated with our day-to-
day living. The parasympathetic nervous system promotes digestion and the synthesis of glycogen, and
allows for normal function and behavior.
Parasympathetic action helps in digestion and absorption of food by increasing the activity of the intestinal
musculature, increasing gastric secretion, and relaxing the pyloric sphincter. It is called the “rest and digest”
division of the ANS.[25]
The parasympathetic nervous system decreases respiration and heart rate and increases digestion.
Stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system results in:
Constriction of pupils
Decreased heart rate and blood pressure
Constriction of bronchial muscles
Increase in digestion
Increased production of saliva and mucus
Increase in urine secretion[26]
The terminology ‘Parasympathetic nervous system’ was introduced by John Newport Langley in 1921. He
was the first person who put forward the concept of PSNS as the second division of the autonomic nervous
system.[27]
