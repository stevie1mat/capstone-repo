Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Neuron
Within a nervous system, a neuron, neurone, or nerve cell is
an electrically excitable cell that fires electric signals called
action 
potentials 
across 
a 
neural 
network. 
Neurons
communicate with other cells via synapses, which are
specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of
chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the
presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap.
Neurons are the main components of nervous tissue in all
animals except sponges and Placozoa. Non-animals like plants
and fungi do not have nerve cells. Molecular evidence suggests
that the ability to generate electric signals first appeared in
evolution some 700 to 800 million years ago, during the Tonian
period. Predecessors of neurons were the peptidergic secretory
cells. They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled
cells to create post-synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that
generate fast electrical signals. The ability to generate electric
signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous
system.[1]
Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their
function. Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch,
sound, or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs, and
they send signals to the spinal cord or brain. Motor neurons
receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control
everything from muscle contractions[2] to glandular output.
Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same
region of the brain or spinal cord. When multiple neurons are
functionally connected together, they form what is called a
neural circuit.
Neurons are special cells which are made up of some structures
that are common to all other eukaryotic cells such as the cell
body (soma), a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular
components.[3] Additionally, neurons have other unique
structures such as dendrites, and a single axon.[3] The soma is a compact structure, and the axon and
dendrites are filaments extruding from the soma. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few
hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock and
travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a constant

diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are axon terminals, where the neuron can transmit a
signal across the synapse to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axon. The term neurite is
used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly when the cell is undifferentiated.
Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the
majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. However, synapses
can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite. The signaling process is partly
electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of voltage gradients
across their membranes. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron
generates an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential. This potential travels rapidly
along the axon and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them. Synaptic signals may be excitatory or
inhibitory, increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma.
In most cases, neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood.
Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.
Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system,
along with the glial cells that give them structural and
metabolic support.[4] The nervous system is made up of the
central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal
cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes the
autonomic, enteric and somatic nervous systems.[5] In
vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central
nervous system, but some reside in peripheral ganglia, and
many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as
the retina and cochlea.
Axons may bundle into fascicles that make up the nerves in the
peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire make up
cables). Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are
called tracts.
Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission
of cellular signals. Given their diversity of functions performed in
different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their
shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma
of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter.[6]
The soma is the body of the neuron. As it contains the
nucleus, most protein synthesis occurs here. The
nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in
diameter.[7]
The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with
many branches. This overall shape and structure are

referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron
occurs via the dendritic spine.
The axon is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of
thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries nerve
signals away from the soma and carries some types of information back to it. Many neurons
have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching,
enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from
the soma is called the axon hillock. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock
also has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most
easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. In
electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative threshold potential.
While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region
can also receive input from other neurons.
The axon terminal is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains
synapses. Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals
are released to communicate with target neurons. In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon
terminal, a neuron may have en passant boutons, which are located along the length of the
axon.
The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its
various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons
often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.[8]
Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically
only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral
nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10–25
micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell
nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human motor neuron can
be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the
toes.
Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the
posterior column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults.
Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along
the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about
axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon, an ideal
experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size
(0.5–1 millimeter thick, several centimeters long).
Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic[9]
however, stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate
functional neurons throughout the life of an organism (see
neurogenesis). Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells. They have
been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell-like
characteristic of pluripotency.

Like all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid
molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it.[10] A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical
insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active.
These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion
pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are
permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be
switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are
chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with
chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The ion materials include sodium, potassium, chloride,
and calcium. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the
membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it
provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the
membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the
membrane.
Numerous microscopic clumps called Nissl bodies (or Nissl
substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a
basophilic ("base-loving") dye. These structures consist of
rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA.
Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz
Nissl (1860–1919), they are involved in protein synthesis and
their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells
are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as aniline
or (weakly) haematoxylin[11] highlight negatively charged
components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the
ribosomal RNA.
The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex
mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments,
which 
together 
with 
neurotubules 
(neuronal
microtubules) are assembled into larger neurofibrils.[12]
Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as
neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is
byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and
lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which
accumulate with age.[13][14][15] Other structural
proteins that are important for neuronal function are
actin and the tubulin of microtubules. Class III β-
tubulin is found almost exclusively in neurons. Actin is
predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites
during neuronal development. There the actin
dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule.[16]
Histology and internal structure

There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. Typical axons almost
never contain ribosomes, except some in the initial segment. Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic
reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases.
Neurons vary in shape and size and can be classified by their
morphology and function.[18] The anatomist Camillo Golgi
grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to
move signals over long distances and type II with short axons,
which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can
be further classified by the location of the soma. The basic
morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor
neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin
axon covered by a myelin sheath. The dendritic tree wraps
around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons.
The end of the axon has branching axon terminals that release
neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between
the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.
Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as:[19]
Unipolar: single process. Unipolar cells are
exclusively sensory neurons. Their dendrites are
receiving sensory information, sometimes directly
from the stimulus itself. The cell bodies of unipolar
neurons are always found in ganglia. Sensory
reception is a peripheral function, so the cell body is
in the periphery, though closer to the CNS in a
ganglion. The axon projects from the dendrite
endings, past the cell body in a ganglion, and into
the central nervous system.
Bipolar: 1 axon and 1 dendrite. They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium, and as part
of the retina.
Multipolar: 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites
Golgi I: neurons with long-projecting axonal processes; examples are pyramidal cells,
Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells
Golgi II: neurons whose axonal process projects locally; the best example is the granule
cell
Anaxonic: where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite(s)
Pseudounipolar: 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite

Some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their
location in the nervous system and distinct shape. Some examples
are:
Basket cells, interneurons that form a dense plexus of
terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the
cortex and cerebellum
Betz cells, large motor neurons
Lugaro cells, interneurons of the cerebellum

Unipolar brush cells, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft
Granule cells, a type of Golgi II neuron
Anterior horn cells, motoneurons located in the spinal cord
Spindle cells, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain
Afferent neurons convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system
and are also called sensory neurons.
Efferent neurons (motor neurons) transmit signals from the central nervous system to the
effector cells.
Interneurons connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system.
Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send
information from the brain.
A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors. The effect
upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated, not by the presynaptic
neuron or by the neurotransmitter. A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key, and a receptor as a lock:
the same neurotransmitter can activate multiple types of receptors. Receptors can be classified broadly as
excitatory (causing an increase in firing rate), inhibitory (causing a decrease in firing rate), or modulatory
(causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).
The two most common (90%+) neurotransmitters in the brain, glutamate and GABA, have largely
consistent actions. Glutamate acts on several types of receptors, and has effects that are excitatory at
ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors. Similarly, GABA acts on several

types of receptors, but all of them have inhibitory effects (in adult animals, at least). Because of this
consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as "excitatory neurons",
and cells that release GABA as "inhibitory neurons". Some other types of neurons have consistent effects,
for example, "excitatory" motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine, and "inhibitory" spinal
neurons that release glycine.
The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute. Rather, it depends on the
class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a
single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and
modulatory effects on others still. For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the
neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF bipolar cells are, like most neurons,
excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead
inhibited by glutamate, because they lack typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class
of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors.[20] When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing
glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes
the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them.
It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic
neuron, based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons typically
dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex, whereas somatostatin-expressing
neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.[21]
Neurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage oscillatory
patterns.[22] So neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics:
Tonic or regular spiking. Some neurons are typically constantly (tonically) active, typically
firing at a constant frequency. Example: interneurons in neurostriatum.
Phasic or bursting. Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic.
Fast-spiking. Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates, for example some types of
cortical inhibitory interneurons, cells in globus pallidus, retinal ganglion cells.[23][24]
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers passed from one neuron
to another neuron or to a muscle cell or gland cell.
Cholinergic neurons – acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is
released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft.
It acts as a ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and
metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic
receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels
composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine.
Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+
depolarization and increases the probability of
presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl
coenzyme A.
Adrenergic neurons – noradrenaline. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is released from most
postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system onto two sets of GPCRs: alpha
Discharge patterns
Neurotransmitter
adrenoceptors and beta adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline is one of the three common
catecholamine neurotransmitter, and the most prevalent of them in the peripheral nervous
system; as with other catecholamines, it is synthesised from tyrosine.
GABAergic neurons – gamma aminobutyric acid. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the
central nervous system (CNS), along with glycine. GABA has a homologous function to ACh,
gating anion channels that allow Cl− ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl− causes
hyperpolarization within the neuron, decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as
the voltage becomes more negative (for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage
threshold must be reached). GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the
enzyme glutamate decarboxylase.
Glutamatergic neurons – glutamate. Glutamate is one of two primary excitatory amino acid
neurotransmitters, along with aspartate. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three
of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor
(often referred to as GPCR).
1. AMPA and Kainate receptors function as cation channels permeable to Na+ cation
channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
2. NMDA receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to Ca2+. The
function of NMDA receptors depend on glycine receptor binding as a co-agonist within
the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.
3. Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic
excitability.
Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted,
resulting in brain damage. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released
from presynaptic neurons, causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than
normal outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca2+ and Na+ entering the
post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid
glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase.
Dopaminergic neurons—dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1
and D5) Gs-coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and
D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA.
Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre- and post-synaptic
neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to
Parkinson's disease. Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine is
catalyzed into levodopa (or L-DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxlase, and levodopa is then converted
into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase.
Serotonergic neurons—serotonin. Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as
excitatory or inhibitory. Of its four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is a ligand-gated
cation channel. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase, and
then further by decarboxylase. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to
depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment,
such as Prozac and Zoloft.
Purinergic neurons—ATP. ATP is a neurotransmitter acting at both ligand-gated ion channels
(P2X receptors) and GPCRs (P2Y) receptors. ATP is, however, best known as a
cotransmitter. Such purinergic signalling can also be mediated by other purines like
adenosine, which particularly acts at P2Y receptors.

Histaminergic neurons—histamine. Histamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter and
neuromodulator. Histamine-producing neurons are found in the tuberomammillary nucleus of
the hypothalamus.[25] Histamine is involved in arousal and regulating sleep/wake behaviors.
Since 2012 there has been a push from the cellular and computational neuroscience community to come up
with a universal classification of neurons that will apply to all neurons in the brain as well as across species.
This is done by considering the three essential qualities of all neurons: electrophysiology, morphology, and
the individual transcriptome of the cells. Besides being universal this classification has the advantage of
being able to classify astrocytes as well. A method called patch-sequencing in which all three qualities can
be measured at once is used extensively by the Allen Institute for Brain Science.[26] In 2023, a
comprehensive cell atlas of the adult, and developing human brain at the transcriptional, epigenetic, and
functional levels was created through an international collaboration of researchers using the most cutting-
edge molecular biology approaches.[27]
Neurons communicate with each other via
synapses, where either the axon terminal of
one cell contacts another neuron's dendrite,
soma or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such
as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have
over 
1000 
dendritic 
branches, 
making
connections with tens of thousands of other
cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular
neurons of the supraoptic nucleus, have only
one or two dendrites, each of which receives
thousands of synapses.
Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory, either
increasing or decreasing activity in the target
neuron, respectively. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically
conductive junctions between cells.[28]

Connectivity

When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing
calcium ions to enter the terminal. Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules
to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse
across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. High cytosolic calcium in the
axon terminal triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy
metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission.[29]
An autapse is a synapse in which a neuron's axon connects to its own dendrites.
The human brain has some 8.6 x 1010 (eighty six billion) neurons.[30][31] Each neuron has on average
7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child
has about 1015 synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates
vary for an adult, ranging from 1014 to 5 x 1014 synapses (100 to 500 trillion).[32]
Beyond electrical and chemical signaling, studies suggest
neurons in healthy human brains can also communicate
through:
force generated by the enlargement of dendritic
spines[33]
the transfer of proteins – transneuronally
transported proteins (TNTPs)[34][35]
They can also get modulated by input from the
environment and hormones released from other parts of the
organism,[36] which could be influenced more or less
directly by neurons. This also applies to neurotrophins such
as BDNF. The gut microbiome is also connected with the
brain.[37] Neurons also communicate with microglia, the
brain's main immune cells via specialised contact sites,
called "somatic junctions". These connections enable
microglia to constantly monitor and regulate neuronal
functions, and exert neuroprotection, when needed.[38]
In 1937 John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant
axon could be used to study neuronal electrical
properties.[39] It is larger than but similar to human
neurons, making it easier to study. By inserting electrodes
into the squid giant axons, accurate measurements were
made of the membrane potential.
Nonelectrochemical signaling
Mechanisms for propagating action
potentials
The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage-gated ion channels that allow the neuron to
generate and propagate an electrical signal (an action potential). Some neurons also generate subthreshold
membrane potential oscillations. These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying ions
including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl−), and calcium (Ca2+).
Several stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity, including pressure, stretch, chemical
transmitters, and changes of the electric potential across the cell membrane.[40] Stimuli cause specific ion-
channels within the cell membrane to open, leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane, changing
the membrane potential. Neurons must maintain the specific electrical properties that define their neuron
type.[41]
Thin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials, but thicker
axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction,
many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells:
oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The
sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst
using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about
1 mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion
channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central
nervous system.
Some neurons do not generate action potentials, but instead generate a graded electrical signal, which in
turn causes graded neurotransmitter release. Such non-spiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or
interneurons, because they cannot carry signals long distances.
Neural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons.
The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the
individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationships among the electrical activities of the
neurons within the ensemble.[42] It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog
information.[43]
The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron
responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation, like brighter image/louder
sound, does not produce a stronger signal but can increase firing frequency.[44]: 
31  Receptors respond in
different ways to stimuli. Slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to a steady stimulus and produce a
steady rate of firing. Tonic receptors most often respond to increased stimulus intensity by increasing their
firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be
likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) requires more
photons, as the photons can not become "stronger" for a specific frequency.
Other receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with a
steady stimulus; examples include skin which, when touched causes neurons to fire, but if the object
maintains even pressure, the neurons stop firing. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to
pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function.

All-or-none principle
As long as the stimulus reaches the threshold, the full
response would be given. A larger stimulus does not
result in a larger response, and vice versa.[44]:

The pacinian corpuscle is one such structure. It has
concentric layers like an onion, which form around
the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the
corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is
transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is
steady, the stimulus ends; thus, these neurons
typically respond with a transient depolarization
during the initial deformation and again when the
pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to
change shape again. Other types of adaptation are
important in extending the function of a number of
other neurons.[45]
The German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer
introduced the term neuron in 1891,[46] based on
the ancient Greek νεῦρον neuron 'sinew, cord,
nerve'.[47]
The word was adopted in French with the spelling neurone. That spelling was also used by many writers in
English,[48] but has now become rare in American usage and uncommon in British usage.[49][47]

To make the structure of
individual neurons visible,
Ramón y Cajal improved a
silver staining process that
had been developed by Camillo Golgi.[50] The improved process
involves a technique called "double impregnation" and is still in
use.
In 1888 Ramón y Cajal published a paper about the bird
cerebellum. In this paper, he stated that he could not find evidence
for anastomosis between axons and dendrites and called each
nervous element "an absolutely autonomous canton."[50][46] This
became known as the neuron doctrine, one of the central tenets of
modern neuroscience.[50]

In 1891, the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer wrote a highly influential review of the neuron
doctrine in which he introduced the term neuron to describe the anatomical and physiological unit of the
nervous system.[51][52]
The silver impregnation stains are a useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because, for reasons
unknown, it stains only a small percentage of cells in a tissue, exposing the complete micro structure of
individual neurons without much overlap from other cells.[53]
The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are
the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. The
theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th
century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a
meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units.
Later discoveries yielded refinements to the doctrine. For example,
glial cells, which are non-neuronal, play an essential role in
information processing.[54] Also, electrical synapses are more
common 
than 
previously 
thought,[55] 
comprising 
direct,
cytoplasmic connections between neurons. In fact, neurons can
form even tighter couplings: the squid giant axon arises from the
fusion of multiple axons.[56]
Ramón y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization,
which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell
body and transmits them, as action potentials, along the axon in one
direction: away from the cell body.[57] The Law of Dynamic
Polarization has important exceptions; dendrites can serve as
synaptic output sites of neurons[58] and axons can receive synaptic
inputs.[59]
Although neurons are often described of as "fundamental units" of the brain, they perform internal
computations. Neurons integrate input within dendrites, and this complexity is lost in models that assume
neurons to be a fundamental unit. Dendritic branches can be modeled as spatial compartments, whose
activity is related due to passive membrane properties, but may also be different depending on input from
synapses. Compartmental modelling of dendrites is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of
neurons that are too small to record with electrodes, as is the case for Drosophila melanogaster.[60]
The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species.[61] In a human, there are an
estimated 10–20 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 55–70 billion neurons in the cerebellum.[62] By
contrast, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just 302 neurons, making it an ideal model
organism as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a
common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex

behaviors. Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition,
are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms
in much simpler experimental systems.
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves (neuropathy) that is
characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs extending to
the hands and arms in advanced stages. Presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common
inherited neurological disorders, affecting 36 in 100,000 people.[63]
Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known simply as Alzheimer's, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized
by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric
symptoms or behavioral changes.[64] The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory
(amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with
illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive
(intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and
recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.[65][66]
Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as Parkinsons, is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous
system that often impairs motor skills and speech.[67] Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions
called movement disorders.[68] It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical
movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary
symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused
by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the
brain. Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems.
PD is both chronic and progressive.
Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during
simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at
the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected
cases, thymectomy.
Demyelination is a process characterized by the gradual loss of the
myelin sheath enveloping nerve fibers. When myelin deteriorates,
signal conduction along nerves can be significantly impaired or lost,
and the nerve eventually withers. Demyelination may affect both
central and peripheral nervous systems, contributing to various
neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré
syndrome, 
and 
chronic

polyneuropathy. Although demyelination is often caused by an autoimmune reaction, it may also be caused
by viral infections, metabolic disorders, trauma, and some medications.
Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts,
axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is the rapid separation of the proximal and
distal ends, occurring within 30 minutes of injury.[69] Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma,
and eventually leads to bead-like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner
organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the
paranodal regions at the site of injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and
eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by the
influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete
fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hours in the PNS and longer in the CNS. The signaling
pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown.
Neurons are born through the process of neurogenesis, in which neural stem cells divide to produce
differentiated neurons. Once fully differentiated neurons are formed, they are no longer capable of
undergoing mitosis. Neurogenesis primarily occurs in the embryo of most organisms.
Adult neurogenesis can occur and studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only
for a minority of cells, and that the vast majority of neurons in the neocortex forms before birth and persists
without replacement. The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans, and its contribution to
cognition are controversial, with conflicting reports published in 2018.[70]
The body contains a variety of stem cell types that have the capacity to differentiate into neurons.
Researchers found a way to transform human skin cells into nerve cells using transdifferentiation, in which
"cells are forced to adopt new identities".[71]
During neurogenesis in the mammalian brain, progenitor and stem cells progress from proliferative divisions
to differentiative divisions. This progression leads to the neurons and glia that populate cortical layers.
Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells,
and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic
modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine
demethylation.[72] These modifications are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult
mammalian brain. DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).
Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative
reactions (e.g. 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair
(BER) pathway.[72]
At different stages of mammalian nervous system development two DNA repair processes are employed in
the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. These pathways are homologous recombinational repair used in
proliferating neural precursor cells, and non-homologous end joining used mainly at later developmental
stages[73]
Axonal degeneration
Neurogenesis
Intercellular communication between developing neurons and microglia is also indispensable for proper
neurogenesis and brain development.[74]
Peripheral axons can regrow if they are severed,[75] but one neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one
of another type (Llinás' law).[22]
