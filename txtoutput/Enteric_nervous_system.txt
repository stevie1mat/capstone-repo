Anatomical terminology
Layers of the Alimentary Canal. The
wall of the alimentary canal has four
basic tissue layers: the mucosa,
submucosa, muscularis, and serosa.
Enteric nervous system
The enteric nervous system (ENS) or intrinsic nervous
system is one of the three main divisions of the autonomic
nervous system (ANS), the other being the sympathetic (SNS)
and parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), and consists of a
mesh-like system of neurons that governs the function of the
gastrointestinal tract.[1] It is capable of acting independently of
the SNS and PSNS, although it may be influenced by them.
The ENS is nicknamed the "second brain".[2][3] It is derived
from neural crest cells.[4][5]
The enteric nervous system is capable of operating
independently of the brain and spinal cord,[6] but is thought to
rely on innervation from the vagus nerve and prevertebral
ganglia in healthy subjects. However, studies have shown that
the system is operable with a severed vagus nerve.[7] The
neurons of the enteric nervous system control the motor
functions of the system, in addition to the secretion of
gastrointestinal enzymes. These neurons communicate through
many neurotransmitters similar to the CNS, including
acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. The large presence of
serotonin and dopamine in the intestines are key areas of
research for neurogastroenterology.[8][9][10]
The enteric nervous system in humans consists of some 500
million neurons[11] (including the various types of Dogiel
cells),[1][12] 0.5% of the number of neurons in the brain, five times
as many as the one hundred million neurons in the human spinal
cord,[13] and about 2⁄3 as many as in the whole nervous system of a
cat. The enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the
gastrointestinal system, beginning in the esophagus and extending
down to the anus.[13]
The neurons of the ENS are collected into two types of ganglia:
myenteric (Auerbach's) and submucosal (Meissner's) plexuses.[14]
Myenteric plexuses are located between the inner and outer layers
of the muscularis externa, while submucosal plexuses are located in
the submucosa.
Structure
Auerbach's plexus
Auerbach's plexus, also known as the myenteric plexus, is a collection of fibers and postganglionic
autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the
gastrointestinal tract. It was discovered and named by German neuropathologist Leopold Auerbach. These
neurons provide motor inputs to both layers of the muscularis externa and provide both parasympathetic and
sympathetic input. The anatomy of the plexus is similar to the anatomy of the central nervous system. The
plexus includes sensory receptors, such as chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors, that are used to provide
sensory input to the interneurons in the enteric nervous system. The plexus is the parasympathetic nucleus
of origin for the vagus nerve and communicates with the medulla oblongata through both the anterior and
posterior vagal nerves.
The submucosal plexus (also known as Meissner's plexus) is found in the submucosal layer of the
gastrointestinal tract.[15] It was discovered and named by German physiologist Georg Meissner. It functions
as a pathway for the innervation in the mucosa layer of the gastrointestinal wall.
The ENS is capable of autonomous functions[16] like the coordination of reflexes; although it receives
considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system, it can and does operate independently of the
brain and the spinal cord.[17] Its study is the focus of neurogastroenterology.
The enteric nervous system has been described as a "second brain" for several reasons. The enteric nervous
system can operate autonomously. It normally communicates with the central nervous system (CNS)
through the parasympathetic (e.g., via the vagus nerve) and sympathetic (e.g., via the prevertebral ganglia)
nervous systems. However, vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed, the enteric
nervous system continues to function.[7]
In vertebrates, the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons, afferent neurons, and interneurons, all
of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in
the absence of CNS input. The sensory neurons report on mechanical and chemical conditions. Through
intestinal muscles, the motor neurons control peristalsis and churning of intestinal contents. Other neurons
control the secretion of enzymes. The enteric nervous system also makes use of more than
30  neurotransmitters, most of which are identical to the ones found in CNS, such as acetylcholine,
dopamine, and serotonin. More than 90% of the body's serotonin lies in the gut, as well as about 50% of the
body's dopamine, which is currently being studied to further our understanding of its utility in the
brain.[18][19][20]
The enteric nervous system has the capacity to alter its response depending on such factors as bulk and
nutrient composition.[21] In addition, the ENS contains support cells which are similar to astroglia of the
brain and a diffusion barrier around the capillaries surrounding ganglia which is similar to the blood–brain
barrier of cerebral blood vessels.[22]

Peristalsis
A simplified image showing
peristalsis
Peristalsis is a series of radially symmetrical contractions and
relaxations of muscles which propagate down a muscular tube. In
humans and other mammals, peristalsis is found in the smooth
muscles of the digestive tract to propel contents through the digestive
system. The word is derived from New Latin and comes from the
Greek peristallein, "to wrap around," from peri-, "around" + stallein,
"to place". Peristalsis was discovered in 1899 by the work of
physiologists William Bayliss and Ernest Starling. Working on the
small intestines of dogs, they found that the response of increasing the
pressure in the intestine caused the contraction of the muscle wall
above the point of stimulation and the relaxation of the muscle wall
below the point of stimulation.[23][6]
Segmentation contractions are the contractions in intestines carried
out by the smooth muscle walls. Unlike peristalsis, which involves
the contraction and relaxation of muscles in one direction,
segmentation occurs simultaneously in both directions as the circular
muscles alternatively contract. This allows for thorough mixing of
intestinal contents, known as chyme, to allow greater absorption.
The secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin and secretin, is regulated through cholinergic
neurons residing in the walls of the digestive tract. Hormone secretion is controlled by the vagovagal reflex,
where the neurons in the digestive tract communicate through both afferent and efferent pathways with the
vagus nerve.[24]
Neurogastroenterology encompasses the study of the brain, the gut, and their interactions with relevance
to the understanding and management of gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders.
Specifically, neurogastroenterology focuses on the functions, malfunctions, and the malformations of the
sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric divisions of the digestive tract.[25] The term also describes a
medical sub-specialism of gastroenterology dedicated to the treatment of motility and functional
gastrointestinal disorders.

Clinical significance
Functional gastrointestinal disorders
Functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are a class of gastrointestinal disorders where there is a
malfunction in the normal activities of the gastrointestinal tract, but there are no structural abnormalities that
can explain the cause. There are rarely any tests that can detect the presence of these disorders. Clinical
research in neurogastroenterology focuses mainly on the study of common functional gastrointestinal
disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, the most common functional GI disorder.[26]
Motility 
disorders 
are 
the 
second 
classification 
of 
gastrointestinal 
disorder 
studied 
by
neurogastroenterologists. Motility disorders are divided by what they affect, with four regions: The
esophagus, the stomach, the small intestines, and the large intestines. Clinical research in
neurogastroenterology focuses mainly on the study of common motility disorders such as gastroesophageal
reflux disease, the damage of the mucosa of the esophagus caused by rising stomach acid through the lower
esophageal sphincter.[27]
ENS function can be damaged by ischemia.[28] Transplantation, previously described as a theoretical
possibility,[29] has been a clinical reality in the United States since 2011 and is regularly performed at some
hospitals.
