Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of two
components that make up the nervous system of bilateral
animals, with the other part being the central nervous system
(CNS). The PNS consists of nerves and ganglia, which lie
outside the brain and the spinal cord.[1] The main function of
the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs,
essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord
and the rest of the body.[2] Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not
protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood–
brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins.[3]
The peripheral nervous system can be divided into the somatic
nervous system and the visceral nervous system. Each of these
have a sensory and a motor division. The visceral motor
division is known as the autonomic nervous system.[4] In the
somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS
with the exceptions of the olfactory nerve and epithelia and the
optic nerve (cranial nerve II) along with the retina, which are
considered parts of the central nervous system based on
developmental origin. The second cranial nerve is not a true
peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon.[5] Cranial
nerve ganglia, as with all ganglia, are part of the PNS.[6] The
autonomic nervous system exerts involuntary control over
smooth muscle and glands.[7] The connection between CNS
and organs allows the system to be in two different functional
states: sympathetic and parasympathetic.
The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic
nervous system, and the autonomic nervous system. The
somatic nervous system is under voluntary control, and
transmits signals from the brain to end organs such as muscles.
The sensory nervous system is part of the somatic nervous
system and transmits signals from senses such as taste and
touch (including fine touch and gross touch) to the spinal cord
and brain. The autonomic nervous system is a "self-regulating"
Structure
system which influences the function of organs outside voluntary control, such as the heart rate, or the
functions of the digestive system.
The somatic nervous system includes the sensory nervous system and the somatosensory system and
consists of sensory nerves and somatic nerves, and many nerves which hold both functions.
In the head and neck, cranial nerves carry somatosensory data. There are twelve cranial nerves, ten of
which originate from the brainstem, and mainly control the functions of the anatomic structures of the head
with some exceptions. One unique cranial nerve is the vagus nerve, which receives sensory information
from organs in the thorax and abdomen. The other unique cranial nerve is the accessory nerve which is
responsible for innervating the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, neither of which are located
exclusively in the head.
For the rest of the body, spinal nerves are responsible for somatosensory information. These arise from the
spinal cord. Usually these arise as a web ("plexus") of interconnected nerves roots that arrange to form
single nerves. These nerves control the functions of the rest of the body. In humans, there are 31 pairs of
spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal. These nerve roots are named
according to the spinal vertebrata which they are adjacent to. In the cervical region, the spinal nerve roots
come out above the corresponding vertebrae (i.e., nerve root between the skull and 1st cervical vertebrae is
called spinal nerve C1). From the thoracic region to the coccygeal region, the spinal nerve roots come out
below the corresponding vertebrae. This method creates a problem when naming the spinal nerve root
between C7 and T1 (so it is called spinal nerve root C8). In the lumbar and sacral region, the spinal nerve
roots travel within the dural sac and they travel below the level of L2 as the cauda equina.
The first 4 cervical spinal nerves, C1 through C4, split and recombine to produce a variety of nerves that
serve the neck and back of head.
Spinal nerve C1 is called the suboccipital nerve, which provides motor innervation to muscles at the base of
the skull. C2 and C3 form many of the nerves of the neck, providing both sensory and motor control. These
include the greater occipital nerve, which provides sensation to the back of the head, the lesser occipital
nerve, which provides sensation to the area behind the ears, the greater auricular nerve and the lesser
auricular nerve.
The phrenic nerve is a nerve essential for our survival which arises from nerve roots C3, C4 and C5. It
supplies the thoracic diaphragm, enabling breathing. If the spinal cord is transected above C3, then
spontaneous breathing is not possible.

Lumbosacral Plexus
The last four cervical spinal nerves, C5 through C8, and the first thoracic spinal nerve, T1, combine to form
the brachial plexus, or plexus brachialis, a tangled array of nerves, splitting, combining and recombining, to
form the nerves that subserve the upper-limb and upper back. Although the brachial plexus may appear
tangled, it is highly organized and predictable, with little variation between people. See brachial plexus
injuries.
The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves, sacral nerves, and coccygeal nerve form the lumbosacral
plexus, the first lumbar nerve being frequently joined by a branch from the twelfth thoracic. For descriptive
purposes this plexus is usually divided into three parts:
lumbar plexus
sacral plexus
pudendal plexus
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls involuntary
responses to regulate physiological functions.[8] The brain and
spinal cord of the central nervous system are connected with organs
that have smooth muscle, such as the heart, bladder, and other
cardiac, exocrine, and endocrine related organs, by ganglionic neurons.[8] The most notable physiological
effects from autonomic activity are pupil constriction and dilation, and salivation of saliva.[8] The autonomic
nervous system is always activated, but is either in the sympathetic or parasympathetic state.[8] Depending
on the situation, one state can overshadow the other, resulting in a release of different kinds of
neurotransmitters.[8]
The sympathetic system is activated during a "fight or flight" situation in which mental stress or physical
danger is encountered.[8] Neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, and epinephrine are released,[8] which
increases heart rate and blood flow in certain areas like muscle, while simultaneously decreasing activities
of non-critical functions for survival, like digestion.[9] The systems are independent to each other, which
allows activation of certain parts of the body, while others remain rested.[9]
Primarily using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) as a mediator, the parasympathetic system allows
the body to function in a "rest and digest" state.[9] Consequently, when the parasympathetic system
dominates the body, there are increases in salivation and activities in digestion, while heart rate and other
sympathetic response decrease.[9] Unlike the sympathetic system, humans have some voluntary controls in
the parasympathetic system. The most prominent examples of this control are urination and defecation.[9]

Enteric nervous system
There is a lesser known division of the autonomic nervous system known as the enteric nervous system.[9]
Located only around the digestive tract, this system allows for local control without input from the
sympathetic or the parasympathetic branches, though it can still receive and respond to signals from the rest
of the body.[9] The enteric system is responsible for various functions related to gastrointestinal system.[9]
Diseases of the peripheral nervous system can be specific to one or more nerves, or affect the system as a
whole.
Any peripheral nerve or nerve root can be damaged, called a mononeuropathy. Such injuries can be
because of injury or trauma, or compression. Compression of nerves can occur because of a tumour mass or
injury. Alternatively, if a nerve is in an area with a fixed size it may be trapped if the other components
increase in size, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Common symptoms of carpal
tunnel syndrome include pain and numbness in the thumb, index and middle finger. In peripheral
neuropathy, the function one or more nerves are damaged through a variety of means. Toxic damage may
occur because of diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), alcohol, heavy metals or other toxins; some infections;
autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis.[8] Peripheral neuropathy is
associated with a sensory loss in a "glove and stocking" distribution that begins at the peripheral and slowly
progresses upwards, and may also be associated with acute and chronic pain. Peripheral neuropathy is not
just limited to the somatosensory nerves, but the autonomic nervous system too (autonomic neuropathy).[8]
