Medulla oblongata
The medulla oblongata or simply medulla is a long
stem-like structure which makes up the lower part of
the brainstem.[1] It is anterior and partially inferior to
the cerebellum. It is a cone-shaped neuronal mass
responsible for autonomic (involuntary) functions,
ranging from vomiting to sneezing.[2] The medulla
contains the cardiac, respiratory, vomiting and
vasomotor centers, and therefore deals with the
autonomic functions of breathing, heart rate and blood
pressure as well as the sleep–wake cycle.[2]
During embryonic development, the medulla oblongata
develops 
from 
the 
myelencephalon. 
The
myelencephalon is a secondary vesicle which forms
during the maturation of the rhombencephalon, also
referred to as the hindbrain.
The bulb is an archaic term for the medulla
oblongata.[1] In modern clinical usage, the word
bulbar (as in bulbar palsy) is retained for terms that
relate to the medulla oblongata, particularly in reference
to medical conditions. The word bulbar can refer to the
nerves and tracts connected to the medulla, and also by
association to those muscles innervated, such as those
of the tongue, pharynx and larynx.
The medulla can be thought of as being in two parts:

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Medulla and parts (10-16) - (10)
pyramid; (11) the anterior
median fissure; (15) is the
choroid plexus in the fourth
ventricle; (13) olive and (7) the
pons
an upper open part or superior part where the
dorsal surface of the medulla is formed by the
fourth ventricle.
a lower closed part or inferior part where the
fourth ventricle has narrowed at the obex in
the caudal medulla, and surrounds part of the
central canal.
The anterior median fissure contains a fold of pia mater,
and extends along the length of the medulla oblongata.
It ends at the lower border of the pons in a small
triangular area, termed the foramen cecum. On either
side of this fissure are raised areas termed the medullary
pyramids. The pyramids house the pyramidal tracts–the
corticospinal and the corticobulbar tracts of the nervous
system. At the caudal part of the medulla these tracts
cross over in the decussation of the pyramids obscuring the fissure at this
point. Some other fibers that originate from the anterior median fissure
above the decussation of the pyramids and run laterally across the
surface of the pons are known as the anterior external arcuate fibers.
The region between the anterolateral and posterolateral sulcus in the
upper part of the medulla is marked by a pair of swellings known as
olivary bodies (also called olives). They are caused by the largest nuclei
of the olivary bodies, the inferior olivary nuclei.
The posterior part of the medulla between the posterior median sulcus
and the posterolateral sulcus contains tracts that enter it from the
posterior funiculus of the spinal cord. These are the gracile fasciculus,
lying medially next to the midline, and the cuneate fasciculus, lying
laterally. These fasciculi end in rounded elevations known as the gracile
and the cuneate tubercles. They are caused by masses of gray matter
known as the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus. The soma (cell
bodies) in these nuclei are the second-order neurons of the posterior
column-medial lemniscus pathway, and their axons, called the internal
arcuate fibers or fasciculi, decussate from one side of the medulla to the
other to form the medial lemniscus.
Just above the tubercles, the posterior aspect of the medulla is occupied by a triangular fossa, which forms
the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The fossa is bounded on either side by the inferior
cerebellar peduncle, which connects the medulla to the cerebellum.
The lower part of the medulla, immediately lateral to the cuneate fasciculus, is marked by another
longitudinal elevation known as the tuberculum cinereum. It is caused by an underlying collection of gray
matter known as the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The gray matter of this nucleus is covered by a layer of

nerve fibers that form the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve. The base of the
medulla is defined by the commissural fibers, crossing over from the ipsilateral side
in the spinal cord to the contralateral side in the brain stem; below this is the spinal
cord.
Blood to the medulla is supplied by a number of arteries.[3]
Anterior spinal artery: This supplies the whole medial part of the
medulla oblongata.
Posterior inferior cerebellar artery: This is a major branch of the
vertebral artery, and supplies the posterolateral part of the medulla,
where the main sensory tracts run and synapse. It also supplies part of
the cerebellum.
Direct branches of the vertebral artery: The vertebral artery supplies an area between the
anterior spinal and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, including the solitary nucleus and
other sensory nuclei and fibers.
Posterior spinal artery: This supplies the dorsal column of the closed medulla containing
fasciculus gracilis, gracile nucleus, fasciculus cuneatus, and cuneate nucleus.
The medulla oblongata forms in fetal development from the myelencephalon. The final differentiation of the
medulla is seen at week 20 gestation.[4]
Neuroblasts from the alar plate of the neural tube at this level will produce the sensory nuclei of the
medulla. The basal plate neuroblasts will give rise to the motor nuclei.
Alar plate neuroblasts give rise to:
The solitary nucleus, which contains the general visceral afferent fibers for taste, as well
as the special visceral afferent column.
The spinal trigeminal nerve nuclei which contains the general somatic afferent column.
The cochlear and vestibular nuclei, which contain the special somatic afferent column.
The inferior olivary nucleus, which relays to the cerebellum.
The dorsal column nuclei, which contain the gracile and cuneate nuclei.
Basal plate neuroblasts give rise to:
The hypoglossal nucleus, which contains general somatic efferent fibers.
The nucleus ambiguus, which form the special visceral efferent.
The dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve and the inferior salivatory nucleus, both of which form
the general visceral efferent fibers.
The medulla oblongata connects the higher levels of the brain to the spinal cord, and is responsible for
several functions of the autonomous nervous system which include:
Blood supply
Development
Function
The control of ventilation via signals from the carotid and aortic bodies. Respiration is
regulated by groups of chemoreceptors. These sensors detect changes in the acidity of the
blood; if, for example, the blood becomes too acidic, the medulla oblongata sends electrical
signals to intercostal and phrenical muscle tissue to increase their contraction rate and
increase oxygenation of the blood. The ventral respiratory group and the dorsal respiratory
group are neurons involved in this regulation. The pre-Bötzinger complex is a cluster of
interneurons involved in the respiratory function of the medulla.
Cardiovascular center – sympathetic, parasympathetic nervous system
Vasomotor center – baroreceptors
Reflex centers of vomiting, coughing, sneezing and swallowing. These reflexes which
include the pharyngeal reflex, the swallowing reflex (also known as the palatal reflex), and
the masseter reflex can be termed bulbar reflexes.[5]
A blood vessel blockage (such as in a stroke) will injure the pyramidal tract, medial lemniscus, and the
hypoglossal nucleus. This causes a syndrome called medial medullary syndrome.
Lateral medullary syndrome can be caused by the blockage of either the posterior inferior cerebellar artery
or of the vertebral arteries.
Progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) is a disease that attacks the nerves supplying the bulbar muscles. Infantile
progressive bulbar palsy is progressive bulbar palsy in children.
Clinical significance
Other animals
Both lampreys and hagfish possess a fully developed medulla oblongata.[6][7] Since these are both very
similar to early agnathans, it has been suggested that the medulla evolved in these early fish, approximately
505 million years ago.[8] The status of the medulla as part of the primordial reptilian brain is confirmed by
its disproportionate size in modern reptiles such as the crocodile, alligator, and monitor lizard.
