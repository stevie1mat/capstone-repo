Sympathetic nervous system
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the three
divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the others being the
parasympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous
system.[1][2] The enteric nervous system is sometimes
considered part of the autonomic nervous system, and
sometimes considered an independent system.[3]
The autonomic nervous system functions to regulate the body's
unconscious actions. The sympathetic nervous system's primary
process is to stimulate the body's fight or flight response. It is,
however, constantly active at a basic level to maintain
homeostasis.[4] The sympathetic nervous system is described as
being antagonistic to the parasympathetic nervous system. The
latter stimulates the body to "feed and breed" and to (then)
"rest-and-digest".
The SNS has a major role in various physiological processes
such as blood glucose levels, body temperature, cardiac output,
and immune system function. The formation of sympathetic
neurons being observed at embryonic stage of life and its
development during aging shows its significance in health; its
dysfunction has shown to be linked to various health
disorders.[5]
There are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of
any signal through the sympathetic system: pre-ganglionic and
post-ganglionic. The shorter preganglionic neurons originate in
the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at T1
to L2~L3, and travel to a ganglion, often one of the
paravertebral 
ganglia, 
where 
they 
synapse 
with 
a
postganglionic neuron. From there, the long postganglionic
neurons extend across most of the body.[6]
At the synapses within the ganglia, preganglionic neurons
release acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that activates nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons. In response
to 
this 
stimulus, 
the 
postganglionic 
neurons 
release
norepinephrine, which activates adrenergic receptors that are
present on the peripheral target tissues. The activation of target

plexuses.
tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the
sympathetic system. However, there are three important
exceptions:[7]
1. Postganglionic neurons of sweat glands release
acetylcholine for the activation of muscarinic
receptors, except for areas of thick skin, the palms
and the plantar surfaces of the feet, where
norepinephrine is released and acts on adrenergic
receptors. This leads to the activation of sudomotor function which is assessed by
electrochemical skin conductance.
2. Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are analogous to post-ganglionic neurons; the
adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system and acts as a
modified sympathetic ganglion. Within this endocrine gland, pre-ganglionic neurons synapse
with chromaffin cells, triggering the release of two transmitters: a small proportion of
norepinephrine, and more substantially, epinephrine. The synthesis and release of
epinephrine as opposed to norepinephrine is another distinguishing feature of chromaffin
cells compared to postganglionic sympathetic neurons.[8]
3. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves terminating in the kidney release dopamine, which acts
on dopamine D1 receptors of blood vessels to control how much blood the kidney filters.
Dopamine is the immediate metabolic precursor to norepinephrine, but is nonetheless a
distinct signaling molecule.[9]
Sympathetic nerves arise from near the middle of the spinal cord in
the intermediolateral nucleus of the lateral grey column, beginning
at the first thoracic vertebra of the vertebral column and are thought
to extend to the second or third lumbar vertebra. Because its cells
begin in the thoracolumbar division – the thoracic and lumbar
regions of the spinal cord – the sympathetic nervous system is said
to have a thoracolumbar outflow. Axons of these nerves leave the
spinal cord through the anterior root. They pass near the spinal
(sensory) ganglion, where they enter the anterior rami of the spinal
nerves. However, unlike somatic innervation, they quickly separate
out through white rami connectors (so called from the shiny white
sheaths of myelin around each axon) that connect to either the
paravertebral (which lie near the vertebral column) or prevertebral
(which lie near the aortic bifurcation) ganglia extending alongside
the spinal column.
To reach target organs and glands, the axons must travel long
distances in the body, and, to accomplish this, many axons relay
their message to a second cell through synaptic transmission. The
ends of the axons link across a space, the synapse, to the dendrites
of the second cell. The first cell (the presynaptic cell) sends a
neurotransmitter across the synaptic cleft where it activates the
second cell (the postsynaptic cell). The message is then carried to
the final destination.

Presynaptic nerves' axons terminate in either the paravertebral
ganglia or prevertebral ganglia. There are four different paths an
axon can take before reaching its terminal. In all cases, the axon
enters the paravertebral ganglion at the level of its originating spinal
nerve. After this, it can then either synapse in this ganglion, ascend
to a more superior or descend to a more inferior paravertebral
ganglion and synapse there, or it can descend to a prevertebral
ganglion and synapse there with the postsynaptic cell.[10]
The postsynaptic cell then goes on to innervate the targeted end
effector (i.e. gland, smooth muscle, etc.). Because paravertebral and
prevertebral ganglia are close to the spinal cord, presynaptic
neurons are much shorter than their postsynaptic counterparts,
which must extend throughout the body to reach their destinations.
A notable exception to the routes mentioned above is the
sympathetic innervation of the suprarenal (adrenal) medulla. In this
case, presynaptic neurons pass through paravertebral ganglia, on through prevertebral ganglia and then
synapse directly with suprarenal tissue. This tissue consists of cells that have pseudo-neuron like qualities in
that when activated by the presynaptic neuron, they will release their neurotransmitter (epinephrine) directly
into the bloodstream.
In the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system, these synapses
are made at sites called ganglia. The cell that sends its fiber is called a preganglionic cell, while the cell
whose fiber leaves the ganglion is called a postganglionic cell. As mentioned previously, the preganglionic
cells of the sympathetic nervous system are located between the first thoracic segment and the third lumbar
segments of the spinal cord. Postganglionic cells have their cell bodies in the ganglia and send their axons to
target organs or glands.
The ganglia include not just the sympathetic trunks but also the cervical ganglia (superior, middle and
inferior), which send sympathetic nerve fibers to the head and thorax organs, and the celiac and mesenteric
ganglia, which send sympathetic fibers to the gut.

Messages travel through the sympathetic nervous system in a bi-
directional flow. Efferent messages can trigger changes in different
parts of the body simultaneously. For example, the sympathetic
nervous system can accelerate heart rate; widen bronchial passages;
decrease motility (movement) of the large intestine; constrict blood
vessels; increase peristalsis in the oesophagus; cause pupillary
dilation, piloerection (goose bumps) and perspiration (sweating);
and raise blood pressure. One exception is with certain blood
vessels such as those in the cerebral and coronary arteries, which
dilate (rather than constrict) with an increase in sympathetic tone.
This is because of a proportional increase in the presence of β2
adrenergic receptors rather than α1 receptors. β2 receptors promote vessel dilation instead of constriction
like α1 receptors. An alternative explanation is that the primary (and direct) effect of sympathetic stimulation

on coronary arteries is vasoconstriction followed by a secondary vasodilation caused by the release of
vasodilatory metabolites due to the sympathetically increased cardiac inotropy and heart rate. This
secondary vasodilation caused by the primary vasoconstriction is termed functional sympatholysis, the
overall effect of which on coronary arteries is dilation.[12] The target synapse of the postganglionic neuron
is mediated by adrenergic receptors and is activated by either norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine
(adrenaline).
The sympathetic nervous system is
responsible for up- and down-regulating
many homeostatic mechanisms in living
organisms. Fibers from the SYNS
innervate tissues in almost every organ
system, 
providing 
at 
least 
some
regulation of functions as diverse as
pupil diameter, gut motility, and urinary
system output and function.[15] It is
perhaps best known for mediating the
neuronal and hormonal stress response
commonly known as the fight-or-flight
response. This response is also known
as sympatho-adrenal response of the
body, as the preganglionic sympathetic
fibers that end in the adrenal medulla
(but also all other sympathetic fibers)
secrete acetylcholine, which activates the great secretion of adrenaline (epinephrine) and to a lesser extent
noradrenaline (norepinephrine) from it. Therefore, this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular
system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly
via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla.
The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for priming the body for action, particularly in situations
threatening survival.[16] One example of this priming is in the moments before waking, in which
sympathetic outflow spontaneously increases in preparation for action.
Sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels, including many of
those in the skin, the digestive tract, and the kidneys. This occurs as a result of activation of alpha-1
adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine released by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons. These receptors
exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta-2 adrenergic
receptors (stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands) in the skeletal muscles, the heart, the
lungs, and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response. The net effect of this is a shunting of blood away
from the organs not necessary to the immediate survival of the organism and an increase in blood flow to
those organs involved in intense physical activity.
Function
Sensation
The afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system, which transmit sensory information from the internal
organs of the body back to the central nervous system (or CNS), are not divided into parasympathetic and
sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are.[17] Instead, autonomic sensory information is conducted by
general visceral afferent fibers.
General visceral afferent sensations are mostly unconscious visceral motor reflex sensations from hollow
organs and glands that are transmitted to the CNS. While the unconscious reflex arcs normally are
undetectable, in certain instances they may send pain sensations to the CNS masked as referred pain. If the
peritoneal cavity becomes inflamed or if the bowel is suddenly distended, the body will interpret the afferent
pain stimulus as somatic in origin. This pain is usually non-localized. The pain is also usually referred to
dermatomes that are at the same spinal nerve level as the visceral afferent synapse.
Together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system,
the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body's internal organs. Reaction to stress
—as in the flight-or-fight response—is thought to be elicited by the sympathetic nervous system and to
counteract the parasympathetic system, which works to promote maintenance of the body at rest. The
comprehensive functions of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems are not so
straightforward, but this is a useful rule of thumb.[4][18]
It was originally believed that the sympathetic nervous system arose with jawed vertebrates.[19] However,
the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), a jawless vertebrate, has been found to contain the key building
blocks and developmental controls of a sympathetic nervous system.[20] Nature described this research as a
"landmark study" that "point to a remarkable diversification of sympathetic neuron populations among
vertebrate classes and species".[21]
The dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system is linked to many health disorders, such as heart failure,
gastrointestinal problems, immune dysfunction as well as, metabolic disorders like, hypertension and
diabetes. Highlighting the importance of the sympathetic nervous system for health.
The sympathetic stimulation of metabolic tissues is required for the maintenance of metabolic regulation and
feedback loops. The dysregulation of this system leads to an increased risk of neuropathy within metabolic
tissues and therefore can worsen or precipitate metabolic disorders. An example of this includes the
retraction of sympathetic neurons due to leptin resistance, which is linked to obesity.[22] Another example,
although more research is required, is the observed link that diabetes results in the impairment of synaptic
transmission due to the inhibition of acetylcholine receptors as a result of high blood glucose levels. The
loss of sympathetic neurons is also associated with the reduction of insulin secretion and impaired glucose
tolerance, further exacerbating the disorder.[23]
The sympathetic nervous system holds a major role in long-term regulation of hypertension, whereby the
central nervous system stimulates sympathetic nerve activity in specific target organs or tissues via
neurohumoral signals. In terms of hypertension, the overactivation of the sympathetic system results in

Disorders
vasoconstriction and increased heart rate resulting in increased blood pressure. In turn, increasing the
potential of the development of cardiovascular disease.[24]
In heart failure, the sympathetic nervous system increases its activity, leading to increased force of muscular
contractions that in turn increases the stroke volume, as well as peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain
blood pressure. However, these effects accelerate disease progression, eventually increasing mortality in
heart failure.[25]
Sympathicotonia is a stimulated[26] condition of the sympathetic nervous system, marked by vascular
spasm,[27] elevated blood pressure,[27] and goose bumps.[27]
Heightened sympathetic nervous system activity is also linked to various mental health disorders such as,
anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is suggested that the overactivation of the
SNS results in the increased severity of PTSD symptoms. In accordance with disorders like hypertension
and cardiovascular disease mentioned above, PTSD is also linked with the increased risk of developing
mentioned diseases, further correlating the link between these disorders and the SNS.[28]
The sympathetic nervous system is sensitive to stress, studies suggest that the chronic dysfunction of the
sympathetic system results in migraines, due to the vascular changes associated with tension headaches.
Individuals with migraine attacks are exhibited to have symptoms that are associated with sympathetic
dysfunction, which include reduced levels of plasma norepinephrine levels, sensitivity of the peripheral
adrenergic receptors.[29]
Insomnia is a sleeping disorder, that makes falling or staying asleep difficult, this disruption in sleep results
in sleep deprivation and various symptoms, with the severity depending on whether the insomnia is acute or
chronic. The most favoured hypothesis for the cause of insomnia is the hyperarousal hypothesis, which is
known as a collective over-activation of various systems in the body, this over-activation includes the
hyperactivity of the SNS. Whereby during sleep cycle disruption sympathetic baroreflex function and
neural cardiovascular responses become impaired.[30][31]
However more research is still required, as methods used in measuring SNS biological measures are not so
reliable due to the sensitivity of the SNS, many factors easily effect its activity, like stress, environment,
timing of day, and disease. These factors can impact results significantly and for more accurate results
extremely invasive methods are required, such as microneurography. The difficultly of measuring the SNS
activity does not only apply to insomnia, but also with various disorders previously discussed. However,
overtime with advancements in technology and techniques in research studies the disruption of the SNS and
its impact on the human body will be explored further. [32][33]
The name of this system can be traced to the concept of sympathy, in the sense of "connection between
parts", first used medically by Galen.[34] In the 18th century, Jacob B. Winslow applied the term
specifically to nerves.[35]
The concept that an independent part of the nervous system coordinates body functions had its origin in the
works of Galen (129–199), who proposed that nerves distributed spirits throughout the body. From animal
dissections he concluded that there were extensive interconnections from the spinal cord to the viscera and
from one organ to another. He proposed that this system fostered a concerted action or 'sympathy' of the

organs. Little changed until the Renaissance when Bartolomeo Eustacheo (1545) depicted the sympathetic
nerves, the vagus and adrenal glands in anatomical drawings. Jacobus Winslow (1669–1760), a Danish-
born professor working in Paris, popularised the term 'sympathetic nervous system' in 1732 to describe the
chain of ganglia and nerves which were connected to the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord.[36]
