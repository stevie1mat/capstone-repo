Cerebral cortex
The cerebral cortex, also known as the cerebral mantle,[1] is
the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain in
humans and other mammals. It is the largest site of neural
integration in the central nervous system,[2] and plays a key role
in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language,
and consciousness. The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain
responsible for cognition.
The six-layered neocortex makes up approximately 90% of the
cortex, with the allocortex making up the remainder.[3] The
cortex is divided into left and right parts by the longitudinal
fissure, which separates the two cerebral hemispheres that are
joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum. In most
mammals, apart from small mammals that have small brains, the
cerebral cortex is folded, providing a greater surface area in the
confined volume of the cranium. Apart from minimising brain
and cranial volume, cortical folding is crucial for the brain
circuitry and its functional organisation.[4] In mammals with
small brains, there is no folding and the cortex is smooth.[5][6]
A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and
a groove is termed a sulcus (plural sulci). These surface
convolutions appear during fetal development and continue to
mature after birth through the process of gyrification. In the
human brain, the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible
from the outside, but buried in the sulci.[7] The major sulci and
gyri mark the divisions of the cerebrum into the lobes of the
brain. The four major lobes are the frontal, parietal, occipital
and temporal lobes. Other lobes are the limbic lobe, and the
insular cortex often referred to as the insular lobe.
There are between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the human
cerebral cortex.[2] These are organised into horizontal cortical
layers, and radially into cortical columns and minicolumns.
Cortical areas have specific functions such as movement in the
motor cortex, and sight in the visual cortex. The motor cortex is
primarily located in the precentral gyrus, and the visual cortex is
located in the occipital lobe.

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Lateral view of cerebrum showing
several cortices
The cerebral cortex is the outer covering of the surfaces of the
cerebral hemispheres and is folded into peaks called gyri, and
grooves called sulci. In the human brain, it is between 2 and 3-4
mm. thick,[8] and makes up 40% of the brain's mass.[2] 90% of
the cerebral cortex is the six-layered neocortex whilst the other
10% made up of three/four-layered allocortex.[2] There are
between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the cortex,[2] and these
are organized radially in cortical columns, and minicolumns, in
the horizontally organized layers of the cortex.[9][10]
The neocortex is separable into different regions of cortex
known in the plural as cortices, and include the motor cortex
and visual cortex. About two thirds of the cortical surface is
buried in the sulci and the insular cortex is completely hidden.
The cortex is thickest over the top of a gyrus and thinnest at the
bottom of a sulcus.[11]
The cerebral cortex is folded in a way that allows a large
surface area of neural tissue to fit within the confines of the
neurocranium. When unfolded in the human, each hemispheric
cortex has a total surface area of about 0.12 square metres
(1.3 sq ft).[12] The folding is inward away from the surface of the
brain, and is also present on the medial surface of each hemisphere
within the longitudinal fissure. Most mammals have a cerebral
cortex that is convoluted with the peaks known as gyri and the
troughs or grooves known as sulci. Some small mammals including
some small rodents have smooth cerebral surfaces without
gyrification.[6]
The larger sulci and gyri mark the divisions of the cortex of the
cerebrum into the lobes of the brain.[8] There are four main lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal
lobe, and occipital lobe. The insular cortex is often included as the insular lobe.[13] The limbic lobe is a rim
of cortex on the medial side of each hemisphere and is also often included.[14] There are also three lobules
of the brain described: the paracentral lobule, the superior parietal lobule, and the inferior parietal lobule.
For species of mammals, larger brains (in absolute terms, not just in relation to body size) tend to have
thicker cortices.[15] The smallest mammals, such as shrews, have a neocortical thickness of about 0.5 mm;
the ones with the largest brains, such as humans and fin whales, have thicknesses of 2–4 mm.[2][8] There is
an approximately logarithmic relationship between brain weight and cortical thickness.[15] Magnetic
resonance imaging of the brain (MRI) makes it possible to get a measure for the thickness of the human
cerebral cortex and relate it to other measures. The thickness of different cortical areas varies but in general,

sensory cortex is thinner than motor cortex.[16] One study has found some positive association between the
cortical thickness and intelligence.[17] Another study has found that the somatosensory cortex is thicker in
migraine patients, though it is not known if this is the result of migraine attacks, the cause of them or if both
are the result of a shared cause.[18][19] A later study using a larger patient population reports no change in
the cortical thickness in patients with migraine.[20] A genetic disorder of the cerebral cortex, whereby
decreased folding in certain areas results in a microgyrus, where there are four layers instead of six, is in
some instances seen to be related to dyslexia.[21]
The neocortex is formed of six layers, numbered I to VI, from the
outermost layer I – near to the pia mater, to the innermost layer VI –
near to the underlying white matter. Each cortical layer has a
characteristic distribution of different neurons and their connections
with other cortical and subcortical regions. There are direct
connections between different cortical areas and indirect
connections via the thalamus.
One of the clearest examples of cortical layering is the line of
Gennari in the primary visual cortex. This is a band of whiter tissue
that can be observed with the naked eye in the calcarine sulcus of
the occipital lobe. The line of Gennari is composed of axons
bringing visual information from the thalamus into layer IV of the
visual cortex.
Staining cross-sections of the cortex to reveal the position of
neuronal cell bodies and the intracortical axon tracts allowed
neuroanatomists in the early 20th century to produce a detailed
description of the laminar structure of the cortex in different
species. The work of Korbinian Brodmann (1909) established that
the mammalian neocortex is consistently divided into six layers.
Layer I is the molecular layer of cerebral cortex|molecular layer, and contains few scattered neurons,
including GABAergic rosehip neurons.[22] Layer I consists largely of extensions of apical dendritic tufts of
pyramidal neurons and horizontally oriented axons, as well as glial cells.[4] During development, Cajal–
Retzius cells[23] and subpial granular layer cells[24] are present in this layer. Also, some spiny stellate cells
can be found here. Inputs to the apical tufts are thought to be crucial for the feedback interactions in the
cerebral cortex involved in associative learning and attention.[25] While it was once thought that the input to
layer I came from the cortex itself,[26] it is now realized that layer I across the cerebral cortex mantle
receives substantial input from matrix or M-type thalamus cells[27] (in contrast to core or C-type that go to
layer IV).[28]

Golgi stain shows the dendrites and

Layer II, the external granular layer, contains small pyramidal
neurons and numerous stellate neurons.
Layer III, the external pyramidal layer, contains predominantly
small and medium-size pyramidal neurons, as well as non-
pyramidal neurons with vertically oriented intracortical axons;
layers I through III are the main target of interhemispheric
corticocortical afferents, and layer III is the principal source of
corticocortical efferents.
Layer IV, the internal granular layer, contains different types of
stellate and pyramidal cells, and is the main target of thalamocortical
afferents from thalamus type C neurons (core-type)[28] as well as
intra-hemispheric corticocortical afferents. The layers above layer
IV are also referred to as supragranular layers (layers I-III), whereas
the layers below are referred to as infragranular layers (layers V and
VI).
Layer V, the internal pyramidal layer, contains large pyramidal
neurons. Axons from these leave the cortex and connect with
subcortical structures including the basal ganglia. In the primary
motor cortex of the frontal lobe, layer V contains giant pyramidal cells called Betz cells, whose axons travel
through the internal capsule, the brain stem, and the spinal cord forming the corticospinal tract, which is the
main pathway for voluntary motor control.
Layer VI, the polymorphic layer or multiform layer, contains few large pyramidal neurons and many
small spindle-like pyramidal and multiform neurons; layer VI sends efferent fibers to the thalamus,
establishing a very precise reciprocal interconnection between the cortex and the thalamus.[29] That is, layer
VI neurons from one cortical column connect with thalamus neurons that provide input to the same cortical
column. These connections are both excitatory and inhibitory. Neurons send excitatory fibers to neurons in
the thalamus and also send collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus that inhibit these same thalamus
neurons or ones adjacent to them.[30] One theory is that because the inhibitory output is reduced by
cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex, this provides the brainstem with adjustable "gain control for the
relay of lemniscal inputs".[30]
The cortical layers are not simply stacked one over the other; there exist characteristic connections between
different layers and neuronal types, which span all the thickness of the cortex. These cortical microcircuits
are grouped into cortical columns and minicolumns.[31] It has been proposed that the minicolumns are the

basic functional units of the cortex.[32] In 1957, Vernon
Mountcastle showed that the functional properties of the cortex
change abruptly between laterally adjacent points; however, they
are continuous in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Later
works have provided evidence of the presence of functionally
distinct cortical columns in the visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel,
1959),[33] auditory cortex, and associative cortex.
Cortical areas that lack a layer IV are called agranular. Cortical
areas that have only a rudimentary layer IV are called
dysgranular.[34] Information processing within each layer is
determined by different temporal dynamics with that in layers II/III
having a slow 2 Hz oscillation while that in layer V has a fast 10–
15 Hz oscillation.[35]
Based on the differences in laminar organization the cerebral cortex
can be classified into two types, the large area of neocortex which
has six cell layers, and the much smaller area of allocortex that has
three or four layers:[3]
The neocortex is also known as the isocortex or
neopallium and is the part of the mature cerebral cortex
with six distinct layers. Examples of neocortical areas
include the granular primary motor cortex, and the striate
primary visual cortex. The neocortex has two subtypes,
the true isocortex and the proisocortex which is a
transitional region between the isocortex and the regions
of the periallocortex.
The allocortex is the part of the cerebral cortex with three
or four layers, and has three subtypes, the paleocortex
with three cortical laminae, the archicortex which has
four or five, and a transitional area adjacent to the
allocortex, the periallocortex. Examples of allocortex are
the olfactory cortex and the hippocampus.
There is a transitional area between the neocortex and the allocortex called the paralimbic cortex, where
layers 2, 3 and 4 are merged. This area incorporates the proisocortex of the neocortex and the periallocortex
of the allocortex. In addition, the cerebral cortex may be classified into four lobes: the frontal lobe, temporal
lobe, the parietal lobe, and the occipital lobe, named from their overlying bones of the skull.
Blood supply to the cerebral cortex is part of the cerebral circulation. Cerebral arteries supply the blood that
perfuses the cerebrum. This arterial blood carries oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients to the cortex.
Cerebral veins drain the deoxygenated blood, and metabolic wastes including carbon dioxide, back to the
heart.

Blood supply and drainage

Cortical blood supply
The main arteries supplying the cortex are the anterior cerebral
artery, the middle cerebral artery, and the posterior cerebral artery.
The anterior cerebral artery supplies the anterior portions of the
brain, including most of the frontal lobe. The middle cerebral artery
supplies the parietal lobes, temporal lobes, and parts of the occipital
lobes. The middle cerebral artery splits into two branches to supply
the left and right hemisphere, where they branch further. The
posterior cerebral artery supplies the occipital lobes.
The circle of Willis is the main blood system that deals with blood
supply in the cerebrum and cerebral cortex.
The prenatal development of the cerebral cortex is a complex and finely tuned process called corticogenesis,
influenced by the interplay between genes and the environment.[36]
The cerebral cortex develops from the most anterior part, the forebrain region, of the neural tube.[37][38]
The neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube. From the cavity inside the neural tube develops
the ventricular system, and, from the neuroepithelial cells of its walls, the neurons and glia of the nervous
system. The most anterior (front, or cranial) part of the neural plate, the prosencephalon, which is evident
before neurulation begins, gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres and later cortex.[39]
Cortical neurons are generated within the ventricular zone, next to the ventricles. At first, this zone contains
neural stem cells, that transition to radial glial cells–progenitor cells, which divide to produce glial cells and
neurons.[40]

Neurogenesis is shown in red and
lamination is shown in blue. Adapted
from (Sur et al. 2001)
The cerebral cortex is composed of a heterogenous population of
cells that give rise to different cell types. The majority of these cells
are derived from radial glia migration that form the different cell
types of the neocortex and it is a period associated with an increase
in neurogenesis. Similarly, the process of neurogenesis regulates
lamination to form the different layers of the cortex. During this
process there is an increase in the restriction of cell fate that begins
with earlier progenitors giving rise to any cell type in the cortex and
later progenitors giving rise only to neurons of superficial layers.
This differential cell fate creates an inside-out topography in the
cortex with younger neurons in superficial layers and older neurons
in deeper layers. In addition, laminar neurons are stopped in S or G2 phase in order to give a fine distinction
between the different cortical layers. Laminar differentiation is not fully complete until after birth since
during development laminar neurons are still sensitive to extrinsic signals and environmental cues.[41]
Although the majority of the cells that compose the cortex are derived locally from radial glia there is a
subset population of neurons that migrate from other regions. Radial glia give rise to neurons that are
pyramidal in shape and use glutamate as a neurotransmitter, however these migrating cells contribute
neurons that are stellate-shaped and use GABA as their main neurotransmitter. These GABAergic neurons
are generated by progenitor cells in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) that migrate tangentially to the
cortex via the subventricular zone. This migration of GABAergic neurons is particularly important since
GABA receptors are excitatory during development. This excitation is primarily driven by the flux of
chloride ions through the GABA receptor, however in adults chloride concentrations shift causing an
inward flux of chloride that hyperpolarizes postsynaptic neurons.[42] The glial fibers produced in the first
divisions of the progenitor cells are radially oriented, spanning the thickness of the cortex from the
ventricular zone to the outer, pial surface, and provide scaffolding for the migration of neurons outwards
from the ventricular zone.[43][44]
At birth there are very few dendrites present on the cortical neuron's cell body, and the axon is
undeveloped. During the first year of life the dendrites become dramatically increased in number, such that
they can accommodate up to a hundred thousand synaptic connections with other neurons. The axon can
develop to extend a long way from the cell body.[45]
The first divisions of the progenitor cells are symmetric, which duplicates the total number of progenitor
cells at each mitotic cycle. Then, some progenitor cells begin to divide asymmetrically, producing one
postmitotic cell that migrates along the radial glial fibers, leaving the ventricular zone, and one progenitor
cell, which continues to divide until the end of development, when it differentiates into a glial cell or an
ependymal cell. As the G1 phase of mitosis is elongated, in what is seen as selective cell-cycle lengthening,
the newly born neurons migrate to more superficial layers of the cortex.[46] The migrating daughter cells
become the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex.[47] The development process is time ordered and
regulated by hundreds of genes and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.[48]

The layered structure of the mature cerebral cortex is formed during
development. The first pyramidal neurons generated migrate out of
the ventricular zone and subventricular zone, together with reelin-
producing Cajal–Retzius neurons, from the preplate. Next, a
cohort of neurons migrating into the middle of the preplate divides
this transient layer into the superficial marginal zone, which will
become layer I of the mature neocortex, and the subplate,[49]
forming a middle layer called the cortical plate. These cells will
form the deep layers of the mature cortex, layers five and six. Later
born neurons migrate radially into the cortical plate past the deep
layer neurons, and become the upper layers (two to four). Thus, the
layers of the cortex are created in an inside-out order.[50] The only
exception to this inside-out sequence of neurogenesis occurs in the
layer I of primates, in which, in contrast to rodents, neurogenesis
continues throughout the entire period of corticogenesis.[51]
The map of functional cortical areas, which include primary motor
and visual cortex, originates from a 'protomap',[52] which is
regulated by molecular signals such as fibroblast growth factor
FGF8 early in embryonic development.[53][54] These signals
regulate the size, shape, and position of cortical areas on the surface
of the cortical primordium, in part by regulating gradients of
transcription factor expression, through a process called cortical
patterning. Examples of such transcription factors include the genes
EMX2 and PAX6.[55] Together, both transcription factors form an
opposing gradient of expression. Pax6 is highly expressed at the
rostral lateral pole, while Emx2 is highly expressed in the
caudomedial pole. The establishment of this gradient is important
for proper development. For example, mutations in Pax6 can cause
expression levels of Emx2 to expand out of its normal expression
domain, which would ultimately lead to an expansion of the areas
normally derived from the caudal medial cortex, such as the visual
cortex. On the contrary, if mutations in Emx2 occur, it can cause the
Pax6-expressing domain to expand and result in the frontal and
motor cortical regions enlarging. Therefore, researchers believe that similar gradients and signaling centers
next to the cortex could contribute to the regional expression of these transcription factors.[42] Two very
well studied patterning signals for the cortex include FGF and retinoic acid. If FGFs are misexpressed in
different areas of the developing cortex, cortical patterning is disrupted. Specifically, when Fgf8 is increased
in the anterior pole, Emx2 is downregulated and a caudal shift in the cortical region occurs. This ultimately
causes an expansion of the rostral regions. Therefore, Fgf8 and other FGFs play a role in the regulation of
expression of Emx2 and Pax6 and represent how the cerebral cortex can become specialized for different
functions.[42]
Cortical patterning
Some functional areas of cortex
Rapid expansion of the cortical surface area is regulated by the amount of self-renewal of radial glial cells
and is partly regulated by FGF and Notch genes.[56] During the period of cortical neurogenesis and layer
formation, many higher mammals begin the process of gyrification, which generates the characteristic folds
of the cerebral cortex.[57][58] Gyrification is regulated by a DNA-associated protein Trnp1[59] and by FGF
and SHH signaling[60][61]
Of all the different brain regions, the cerebral cortex shows the largest evolutionary variation and has
evolved most recently.[6] In contrast to the highly conserved circuitry of the medulla oblongata, for
example, which serves critical functions such as regulation of heart and respiration rates, many areas of the
cerebral cortex are not strictly necessary for survival. Thus, the evolution of the cerebral cortex has seen the
advent and modification of new functional areas—particularly association areas that do not directly receive
input from outside the cortex.[6]
A key theory of cortical evolution is embodied in the radial unit hypothesis and related protomap
hypothesis, first proposed by Rakic.[62] This theory states that new cortical areas are formed by the addition
of new radial units, which is accomplished at the stem cell level. The protomap hypothesis states that the
cellular and molecular identity and characteristics of neurons in each cortical area are specified by cortical
stem cells, known as radial glial cells, in a primordial map. This map is controlled by secreted signaling
proteins and downstream transcription factors.[63][64][65]
The cerebral cortex is connected to various subcortical structures
such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia, sending information to
them along efferent connections and receiving information from
them via afferent connections. Most sensory information is routed to
the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. Olfactory information,
however, passes through the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex
(piriform cortex). The majority of connections are from one area of
the cortex to another, rather than from subcortical areas; Braitenberg
and Schüz (1998) claim that in primary sensory areas, at the cortical
level where the input fibers terminate, up to 20% of the synapses
are supplied by extracortical afferents but that in other areas and
other layers the percentage is likely to be much lower.[66]
The whole of the cerebral cortex was divided into 52 different areas in an early presentation by Korbinian
Brodmann. These areas known as Brodmann areas, are based on their cytoarchitecture but also relate to
various functions. An example is Brodmann area 17 which is the primary visual cortex.

Cortical areas
Motor and sensory regions of the
cerebral cortex
In more general terms the cortex is typically described as comprising three parts: sensory, motor, and
association areas.
The sensory areas are the cortical areas that receive and process
information from the senses. Parts of the cortex that receive sensory
inputs from the thalamus are called primary sensory areas. The
senses of vision, hearing, and touch are served by the primary
visual cortex, primary auditory cortex and primary somatosensory
cortex respectively. In general, the two hemispheres receive
information from the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. For
example, the right primary somatosensory cortex receives
information from the left limbs, and the right visual cortex receives
information from the left visual field. The organization of sensory
maps in the cortex reflects that of the corresponding sensing organ,
in what is known as a topographic map. Neighboring points in the
primary visual cortex, for example, correspond to neighboring
points in the retina. This topographic map is called a retinotopic
map. In the same way, there exists a tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex and a somatotopic map in
the primary sensory cortex. This last topographic map of the body onto the posterior central gyrus has been
illustrated as a deformed human representation, the somatosensory homunculus, where the size of different
body parts reflects the relative density of their innervation. Areas with much sensory innervation, such as
the fingertips and the lips, require more cortical area to process finer sensation.
The motor areas are located in both hemispheres of the cortex. The motor areas are very closely related to
the control of voluntary movements, especially fine fragmented movements performed by the hand. The
right half of the motor area controls the left side of the body, and vice versa.
Two areas of the cortex are commonly referred to as motor:
Primary motor cortex, which executes voluntary movements [67]
Supplementary motor areas and premotor cortex, which select voluntary movements.[68]
In addition, motor functions have been described for:
Posterior parietal cortex, which guides voluntary movements in space
Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which decides which voluntary movements to make according
to higher-order instructions, rules, and self-generated thoughts.
Just underneath the cerebral cortex are interconnected subcortical masses of grey matter called basal ganglia
(or nuclei). The basal ganglia receive input from the substantia nigra of the midbrain and motor areas of the
cerebral cortex, and send signals back to both of these locations. They are involved in motor control. They
are found lateral to the thalamus. The main components of the basal ganglia are the caudate nucleus, the
putamen, the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, the nucleus accumbens, and the subthalamic nucleus.

Cortical areas involved in speech
processing.
The putamen and globus pallidus are also collectively known as the lentiform nucleus, because together
they form a lens-shaped body. The putamen and caudate nucleus are also collectively called the corpus
striatum after their striped appearance.[69][70]
The association areas are the parts of the cerebral cortex that do not
belong to the primary regions. They function to produce a
meaningful perceptual experience of the world, enable us to interact
effectively, and support abstract thinking and language. The
parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes – all located in the posterior
part of the cortex – integrate sensory information and information
stored in memory. The frontal lobe or prefrontal association
complex is involved in planning actions and movement, as well as
abstract thought. Globally, the association areas are organized as
distributed networks.[71] Each network connects areas distributed
across widely spaced regions of the cortex. Distinct networks are positioned adjacent to one another
yielding a complex series of interwoven networks. The specific organization of the association networks is
debated with evidence for interactions, hierarchical relationships, and competition between networks.
In humans, association networks are particularly important to language function. In the past it was theorized
that language abilities are localized in Broca's area in areas of the left inferior frontal gyrus, BA44 and
BA45, for language expression and in Wernicke's area BA22, for language reception. However, the
processes of language expression and reception have been shown to occur in areas other than just those
structures around the lateral sulcus, including the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and pons.[72]
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, show as a marker, an atrophy of the grey matter of
the cerebral cortex.[74]
Other diseases of the central nervous system include neurological disorders such as epilepsy, movement
disorders, and different types of aphasia (difficulties in speech expression or comprehension).
Brain damage from disease or trauma, can involve damage to a specific lobe such as in frontal lobe disorder,
and associated functions will be affected. The blood–brain barrier that serves to protect the brain from
infection can become compromised allowing entry to pathogens.
The developing fetus is susceptible to a range of environmental factors that can cause birth defects and
problems in later development. Maternal alcohol consumption for example can cause fetal alcohol spectrum
disorder.[75] Other factors that can cause neurodevelopment disorders are toxicants such as drugs, and
exposure to radiation as from X-rays. Infections can also affect the development of the cortex. A viral
infection is one of the causes of lissencephaly, which results in a smooth cortex without gyrification.

There are a number of genetic mutations that can cause a wide range of genetic disorders of the cerebral
cortex, including microcephaly, schizencephaly and types of lissencephaly.[77] Chromosome abnormalities
can also result causing a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Rett
syndrome.
MCPH1 codes for microcephalin, and disorders in this and in ASPM are associated with microcephaly.[77]
Mutations in the gene NBS1 that codes for nibrin can cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome, characterised by
microcephaly.[77]
Mutations in EMX2,[78] and COL4A1 are associated with schizencephaly,[79] a condition marked by the
absence of large parts of the cerebral hemispheres.
In 1909, Korbinian Brodmann distinguished different areas of the neocortex based on cytoarchitectural
difference and divided the cerebral cortex into 52 regions.[80]
Rafael Lorente de Nó, a student of Santiago Ramon y Cajal identified more than 40 different types of
cortical neurons based on the distribution of their dendrites and axons.[80]

History
Other animals
The cerebral cortex is derived from the pallium, a layered structure found in the forebrain of all vertebrates.
The basic form of the pallium is a cylindrical layer enclosing fluid-filled ventricles. Around the
circumference of the cylinder are four zones, the dorsal pallium, medial pallium, ventral pallium, and lateral
pallium, which are thought to be homologous to the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory
cortex, respectively.
In avian brains, evidence suggests the avian pallium's neuroarchitecture to be reminiscent of the mammalian
cerebral cortex.[81] The avian pallium has also been suggested to be an equivalent neural basis for
consciousness.[82][83]
Until recently no counterpart to the cerebral cortex had been recognized in invertebrates. However, a study
published in the journal Cell in 2010, based on gene expression profiles, reported strong affinities between
the cerebral cortex and the mushroom bodies of the ragworm Platynereis dumerilii.[84] Mushroom bodies
are structures in the brains of many types of worms and arthropods that are known to play important roles in
learning and memory; the genetic evidence indicates a common evolutionary origin, and therefore indicates
that the origins of the earliest precursors of the cerebral cortex date back to the Precambrian era.
