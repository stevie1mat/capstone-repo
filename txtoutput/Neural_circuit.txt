Neural circuit
A neural circuit is a population of neurons
interconnected by synapses to carry out a specific
function when activated.[1] Multiple neural circuits
interconnect with one another to form large scale brain
networks.[2]
Neural circuits have inspired the design of artificial
neural 
networks, 
though 
there 
are 
significant
differences.
Early treatments of neural networks can be found in
Herbert Spencer's Principles of Psychology, 3rd
edition (1872), Theodor Meynert's Psychiatry (1884),
William James' Principles of Psychology (1890), and
Sigmund Freud's Project for a Scientific Psychology
(composed 1895).[3] The first rule of neuronal learning
was described by Hebb in 1949, in the Hebbian theory.
Thus, Hebbian pairing of pre-synaptic and post-
synaptic activity can substantially alter the dynamic
characteristics of the synaptic connection and therefore
either facilitate or inhibit signal transmission. In 1959,
the neuroscientists, Warren Sturgis McCulloch and
Walter Pitts published the first works on the processing
of neural networks.[4] They showed theoretically that
networks of artificial neurons could implement logical,
arithmetic, and symbolic functions. Simplified models
of biological neurons were set up, now usually called
perceptrons or artificial neurons. These simple models
accounted for neural summation (i.e., potentials at the
post-synaptic membrane will summate in the cell
body). Later models also provided for excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic transmission.
The connections between neurons in the brain are much more complex than those of the artificial neurons
used in the connectionist neural computing models of artificial neural networks. The basic kinds of
connections between neurons are synapses: both chemical and electrical synapses.

The establishment of synapses enables the connection of neurons
into millions of overlapping, and interlinking neural circuits.
Presynaptic proteins called neurexins are central to this process.[5]
One principle by which neurons work is neural summation –
potentials at the postsynaptic membrane will sum up in the cell
body. If the depolarization of the neuron at the axon hillock goes
above threshold an action potential will occur that travels down the
axon to the terminal endings to transmit a signal to other neurons.
Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is realized mostly by
excitatory 
postsynaptic 
potentials 
(EPSPs), 
and 
inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs).
On the electrophysiological level, there are various phenomena
which alter the response characteristics of individual synapses
(called synaptic plasticity) and individual neurons (intrinsic
plasticity). These are often divided into short-term plasticity and
long-term plasticity. Long-term synaptic plasticity is often
contended to be the most likely memory substrate. Usually, the term
"neuroplasticity" refers to changes in the brain that are caused by
activity or experience.
Connections display temporal and spatial characteristics. Temporal characteristics refers to the continuously
modified activity-dependent efficacy of synaptic transmission, called spike-timing-dependent plasticity. It
has been observed in several studies that the synaptic efficacy of this transmission can undergo short-term
increase (called facilitation) or decrease (depression) according to the activity of the presynaptic neuron.
The induction of long-term changes in synaptic efficacy, by long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression
(LTD), depends strongly on the relative timing of the onset of the excitatory postsynaptic potential and the
postsynaptic action potential. LTP is induced by a series of action potentials which cause a variety of
biochemical responses. Eventually, the reactions cause the expression of new receptors on the cellular
membranes of the postsynaptic neurons or increase the efficacy of the existing receptors through
phosphorylation.
Backpropagating action potentials cannot occur because after an action potential travels down a given
segment of the axon, the m gates on voltage-gated sodium channels close, thus blocking any transient
opening of the h gate from causing a change in the intracellular sodium ion (Na+) concentration, and
preventing the generation of an action potential back towards the cell body. In some cells, however, neural
backpropagation does occur through the dendritic branching and may have important effects on synaptic
plasticity and computation.
A neuron in the brain requires a single signal to a neuromuscular junction to stimulate contraction of the
postsynaptic muscle cell. In the spinal cord, however, at least 75 afferent neurons are required to produce
firing. This picture is further complicated by variation in time constant between neurons, as some cells can
experience their EPSPs over a wider period of time than others.
Model of a neural circuit in the
cerebellum
While in synapses in the developing brain synaptic depression has been particularly widely observed it has
been speculated that it changes to facilitation in adult brains.
An example of a neural circuit is the trisynaptic circuit in the
hippocampus. Another is the Papez circuit linking the hypothalamus
to the limbic lobe. There are several neural circuits in the cortico-
basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. These circuits carry information
between the cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and back to the cortex.
The largest structure within the basal ganglia, the striatum, is seen
as having its own internal microcircuitry.[6]
Neural circuits in the spinal cord called central pattern generators
are responsible for controlling motor instructions involved in
rhythmic behaviours. Rhythmic behaviours include walking,
urination, and ejaculation. The central pattern generators are made
up of different groups of spinal interneurons.[7]
There are four principal types of neural circuits that are responsible for a broad scope of neural functions.
These circuits are a diverging circuit, a converging circuit, a reverberating circuit, and a parallel after-
discharge circuit.[8]
In a diverging circuit, one neuron synapses with a number of postsynaptic cells. Each of these may synapse
with many more making it possible for one neuron to stimulate up to thousands of cells. This is exemplified
in the way that thousands of muscle fibers can be stimulated from the initial input from a single motor
neuron.[8]
In a converging circuit, inputs from many sources are converged into one output, affecting just one neuron
or a neuron pool. This type of circuit is exemplified in the respiratory center of the brainstem, which
responds to a number of inputs from different sources by giving out an appropriate breathing pattern.[8]
A reverberating circuit produces a repetitive output. In a signalling procedure from one neuron to another in
a linear sequence, one of the neurons may send a signal back to initiating neuron. Each time that the first
neuron fires, the other neuron further down the sequence fire again sending it back to the source. This
restimulates the first neuron and also allows the path of transmission to continue to its output. A resulting
repetitive pattern is the outcome that only stops if one or more of the synapses fail, or if an inhibitory feed
from another source causes it to stop. This type of reverberating circuit is found in the respiratory center that
sends signals to the respiratory muscles, causing inhalation. When the circuit is interrupted by an inhibitory
signal the muscles relax causing exhalation. This type of circuit may play a part in epileptic seizures.[8]
In a parallel after-discharge circuit, a neuron inputs to several chains of neurons. Each chain is made up of a
different number of neurons but their signals converge onto one output neuron. Each synapse in the circuit
acts to delay the signal by about 0.5 msec, so that the more synapses there are, the longer is the delay to the
Circuitry
output neuron. After the input has stopped, the output will go on firing for some time. This type of circuit
does not have a feedback loop as does the reverberating circuit. Continued firing after the stimulus has
stopped is called after-discharge. This circuit type is found in the reflex arcs of certain reflexes.[8]
Different neuroimaging techniques have been developed to investigate the activity of neural circuits and
networks. The use of "brain scanners" or functional neuroimaging to investigate the structure or function of
the brain is common, either as simply a way of better assessing brain injury with high-resolution pictures, or
by examining the relative activations of different brain areas. Such technologies may include functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain positron emission tomography (brain PET), and computed axial
tomography (CAT) scans. Functional neuroimaging uses specific brain imaging technologies to take scans
from the brain, usually when a person is doing a particular task, in an attempt to understand how the
activation of particular brain areas is related to the task. In functional neuroimaging, especially fMRI, which
measures hemodynamic activity (using BOLD-contrast imaging) which is closely linked to neural activity,
PET, and electroencephalography (EEG) is used.
Connectionist models serve as a test platform for different hypotheses of representation, information
processing, and signal transmission. Lesioning studies in such models, e.g. artificial neural networks, where
parts of the nodes are deliberately destroyed to see how the network performs, can also yield important
insights in the working of several cell assemblies. Similarly, simulations of dysfunctional neurotransmitters
in neurological conditions (e.g., dopamine in the basal ganglia of Parkinson's patients) can yield insights
into the underlying mechanisms for patterns of cognitive deficits observed in the particular patient group.
Predictions from these models can be tested in patients or via pharmacological manipulations, and these
studies can in turn be used to inform the models, making the process iterative.
The modern balance between the connectionist approach and the single-cell approach in neurobiology has
been achieved through a lengthy discussion. In 1972, Barlow announced the single neuron revolution: "our
perceptions are caused by the activity of a rather small number of neurons selected from a very large
population of predominantly silent cells."[9] This approach was stimulated by the idea of grandmother cell
put forward two years earlier. Barlow formulated "five dogmas" of neuron doctrine. Recent studies of
'grandmother cell' and sparse coding phenomena develop and modify these ideas.[10] The single cell
experiments used intracranial electrodes in the medial temporal lobe (the hippocampus and surrounding
cortex). Modern development of concentration of measure theory (stochastic separation theorems) with
applications to artificial neural networks give mathematical background to unexpected effectiveness of small
neural ensembles in high-dimensional brain.[11]
Sometimes neural circuitries can become pathological and cause problems such as in Parkinson's disease
when the basal ganglia are involved.[12] Problems in the Papez circuit can also give rise to a number of
neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's.
