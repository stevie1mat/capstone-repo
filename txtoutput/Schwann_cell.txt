Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Schwann cell
Schwann cells or neurolemmocytes (named after German
physiologist Theodor Schwann) are the principal glia of the
peripheral nervous system (PNS). Glial cells function to support
neurons and in the PNS, also include satellite cells, olfactory
ensheathing cells, enteric glia and glia that reside at sensory
nerve endings, such as the Pacinian corpuscle. The two types of
Schwann cells are myelinating and nonmyelinating.[1]
Myelinating Schwann cells wrap around axons of motor and
sensory neurons to form the myelin sheath. The Schwann cell
promoter is present in the downstream region of the human
dystrophin gene that gives shortened transcript that are again
synthesized in a tissue-specific manner.
During the development of the PNS, the regulatory
mechanisms of myelination are controlled by feedforward
interaction of specific genes, influencing transcriptional
cascades and shaping the morphology of the myelinated nerve
fibers.[2]
Schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of
peripheral nerve biology—the conduction of nervous impulses
along axons, nerve development and regeneration, trophic
support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular matrix, modulation of neuromuscular synaptic
activity, and presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes.
Charcot–Marie–Tooth 
disease, 
Guillain–Barré 
syndrome 
(acute 
inflammatory 
demyelinating
polyradiculopathy type), schwannomatosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and
leprosy are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.
Schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres (both myelinated and
unmyelinated) alive. In myelinated axons, Schwann cells form the myelin sheath. The sheath is not
continuous. Individual myelinating Schwann cells cover about 1 mm of an axon[3]—equating to about 1000
Schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon. The gaps between adjacent Schwann cells are called nodes
of Ranvier.
9-O-Acetyl GD3 ganglioside is an acetylated glycolipid which is found in the cell membranes of many
types of vertebrate cells. During peripheral nerve regeneration, 9-O-acetyl GD3 is expressed by Schwann
cells.[4]
Structure
Function
Schwann cells wrapped around an axon
The vertebrate nervous system relies
on the myelin sheath for insulation and
as a method of decreasing membrane
capacitance in the axon. The action
potential jumps from node to node, in a
process called saltatory conduction,
which can increase conduction velocity
up to 10 times, without an increase in
axonal 
diameter. 
In 
this 
sense,
Schwann cells are the PNS's analogues
of 
the 
central 
nervous 
system's
oligodendrocytes. 
However, 
unlike
oligodendrocytes, 
each 
myelinating
Schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon (see image). This arrangement permits saltatory
conduction of action potentials with repropagation at the nodes of Ranvier. In this way, myelination greatly
increases speed of conduction and saves energy.[5]
Nonmyelinating Schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival.

Myelinating Schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work
by spiraling around the axon, sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions. A well-developed Schwann cell
is shaped like a rolled-up sheet of paper, with layers of myelin between each coil. The inner layers of the
wrapping, which are predominantly membrane material, form the myelin sheath, while the outermost layer
of nucleated cytoplasm forms the neurilemma. Only a small volume of residual cytoplasm allows
communication between the inner and outer layers. This is seen histologically as the Schmidt-Lantermann
incisure.
Schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration.[6] Nerves in the PNS consist of
many axons myelinated by Schwann cells. If damage occurs to a nerve, the Schwann cells aid in digestion
of its axons (phagocytosis). Following this process, the Schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a
type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons. This tunnel is known as band of Büngner, a guidance
track for the regenerating axons, which behaves like an endoneural tube. The stump of the damaged axon is
able to sprout, and those sprouts that grow through the Schwann-cell "tunnel" do so at the rate around
1  mm/day in good conditions. The rate of regeneration decreases with time. Successful axons can,
therefore, reconnect with the muscles or organs they previously controlled with the help of Schwann cells,
but specificity is not maintained and errors are frequent, especially when long distances are involved.[7]
Because of their ability to impact regeneration of axons, Schwann cells have been connected to preferential
motor reinnervation, as well. If Schwann cells are prevented from associating with axons, the axons die.
Regenerating axons will not reach any target unless Schwann cells are there to support them and guide
them. They have been shown to be in advance of the growth cones.

Schwann cells are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons. They produce a variety of factors,
including neurotrophins, and also transfer essential molecules across to axons.
SOX10 is a transcription factor active during embryonic development and
abundant evidence indicates that it is essential for the generation of glial
lineages from trunk crest cells.[8][9] When SOX10 is inactivated in mice,
satellite glia and Schwann cell precursors fail to develop, though neurons are
generated normally without issue.[8] In the absence of SOX10, neural crest
cells survive and are free to generate neurons, but glial specification is
blocked.[9] SOX10 might influence early glial precursors to respond to
neuregulin 1[8] (see below).
Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) acts in a number of ways to both promote the formation
and ensure the survival of immature Schwann cells.[10] During embryonic
development, NRG1 inhibits the formation of neurons from neural crest cells,
instead contributing to neural crest cells being led down a path to gliogenesis.
NRG1 signaling is not, however, required for glial differentiation from the
neural crest.[11]
NRG1 plays important roles in the development of neural crest derivatives. It is required for neural crest
cells to migrate past the site of dorsal root ganglia to find the ventral regions of sympathetic
gangliogenesis.[12] It is also an essential axon-derived survival factor and a mitogen for Schwann cell
precursors.[13] It is found in the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons at the point in time that Schwann
cell precursors begin to populate spinal nerves and therefore influences Schwann cell survival.[11] In
embryonic nerves, the transmembrane III isoform likely is the primary variant of NRG1 responsible for
survival signals. In mice that lack the transmembrane III isoform, Schwann cell precursors are eventually
eliminated from spinal nerves.[14]
Myelin protein zero (P0) is a cell-adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is
the major component of peripheral myelin, constituting over 50% of the total protein in the sheath.[15][16]
P0 has been shown to be essential for the formation of compact myelin, as P0 null mutant (P0-) mice
showed severely aberrant peripheral myelination.[17] Although myelination of large caliber axons was
initiated in P0- mice, the resulting myelin layers were very thin and poorly compacted. Unexpectedly, P0-
mice also showed degeneration of both axons and their surround myelin sheaths, suggesting that P0 plays a

role in maintaining the structural integrity of both myelin formation and the axon with which it is associated.
P0- mice developed behavioral deficits around 2 weeks of age when mice began to show signs of slight
trembling. Gross incoordination also arose as the animals developed, while trembling became more severe
and some older mice developed convulsing behaviors. Despite the array of impaired motor behavior, no
paralysis was observed in these animals. P0 is also an important gene expressed early within the Schwann
cell lineage, expressed in Schwann cell precursors after differentiating from migrating neural crest cells
within the developing embryo.[18]
Several important transcription factors are also expressed and involved at various stages in development
changing the features on the Schwann cells from an immature to mature state. One indispensable
transcription factor expressed during the myelination process is Krox-20. It is a general zinc-finger
transcription factor and is expressed in the rhombomeres 3 and 5.
Krox-20 is considered one of the master regulators of PNS myelination and is important in driving
transcription of specific structural proteins in the myelin. It has been shown to control a set of genes
responsible for interfering with this feature in the axon changing it from a pro-myelinating to myelinating
state.[19] In this way, in Krox-20 double knock out mice, it has been recorded that hindbrain segmentation is
affected as well as myelination of Schwann cell associated axons. Indeed, in these mice, the Schwann cells
are not able to perform their myelination properly as they only wrap their cytoplasmic processes one and
half turn around the axon and despite the fact that they still express the early myelin marker, late myelin
gene products are absent. In addition, recent studies have also proven the importance of this transcription
factor in maintaining the myelination phenotype (and requires the co-expression of Sox 10) as its
inactivation leads to dedifferentiation of the Schwann cells.[2]
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS, acute inflammatory demyelinating
polyradiculopathy type), schwannomatosis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
(CIDP), leprosy, and Zika Virus are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.[20]
A number of experimental studies since 2001 have implanted Schwann cells in an attempt to induce
remyelination in multiple sclerosis-afflicted patients.[21] In the past two decades, many studies have
demonstrated positive results and potential for Schwann cell transplantation as a therapy for spinal cord
injury, both in aiding regrowth and myelination of damaged CNS axons.[22] Schwann cell transplants in
combination with other therapies such as Chondroitinase ABC have also been shown to be effective in
functional recovery from spinal cord injury.[23]
