Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Motor nerve
A motor nerve, or efferent nerve, is a nerve that contains
exclusively efferent nerve fibers and transmits motor signals
from the central nervous system (CNS) to the muscles of the
body. This is different from the motor neuron, which includes a
cell body and branching of dendrites, while the nerve is made
up of a bundle of axons. Motor nerves act as efferent nerves
which carry information out from the CNS to muscles, as
opposed to afferent nerves (also called sensory nerves), which
transfer signals from sensory receptors in the periphery to the
CNS.[1] Efferent nerves can also connect to glands or other
organs/issues instead of muscles (and so motor nerves are not
equivalent to efferent nerves).[2][3] The vast majority of nerves
contain both sensory and motor fibers and are therefore called
mixed nerves.[4]
Motor nerve fibers transduce signals from the CNS to
peripheral neurons of proximal muscle tissue. Motor nerve axon
terminals innervate skeletal and smooth muscle, as they are
heavily involved in muscle control. Motor nerves tend to be
rich in acetylcholine vesicles because the motor nerve, a bundle
of motor nerve axons that deliver motor signals and signal for
movement and motor control.[5] Calcium vesicles reside in the
axon terminals of the motor nerve bundles. The high calcium
concentration outside of presynaptic motor nerves increases the
size of end-plate potentials (EPPs).[6]
Within motor nerves, each axon is wrapped by the
endoneurium, which is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the myelin sheath. Bundles of axons are
called fascicles, which are wrapped in perineurium. All of the fascicles wrapped in the perineurium are
wound together and wrapped by a final layer of connective tissue known as the epineurium. These
protective tissues defend nerves from injury, pathogens and help to maintain nerve function. Layers of
connective tissue maintain the rate at which nerves conduct action potentials.[7]
Structure and function

Most motor pathways originate in the motor cortex of the brain. Signals run down the brainstem and spinal
cord ipsilaterally, on the same side, and exit the spinal cord at the ventral horn of the spinal cord on either
side. Motor nerves communicate with the muscle cells they innervate through motor neurons once they exit
the spinal cord.[1][7]
Motor nerves can vary based on the subtype of motor neuron they are associate with.[8]
Alpha motor neurons target extrafusal muscle fibers. The motor nerves associated with these neurons
innervate extrafusal fibers and are responsible for muscle contraction. These nerve fibers have the largest
diameter of the motor neurons and require the highest conduction velocity of the three types.[8]
Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles. These nerves are responsible for signaling
slow twitch muscle fibers.[8]
Gamma motor neurons, unlike alpha motor neurons, are not directly involved in muscle contraction. The
nerves associated with these neurons do not send signals that directly adjust the shortening or lengthening of
muscle fibers. However, these nerves are important in keeping muscle spindles taut.[8]

Neurodegeneration
Neural stem cells seen in green
Motor neural degeneration is the progressive weakening of neural tissues and connections in the nervous
system. Muscles begin to weaken as there are no longer any motor nerves or pathways that allows for
muscle innervation. Motor neuron diseases can be viral, genetic or be a result of environmental factors. The
exact causes remain unclear, however many experts believe that toxic and environmental factors play a
large role.[9]
There are problems with neuroregeneration due to many sources,
both internal and external. There is a weak regenerative ability of
nerves and new nerve cells cannot simply be made. The outside
environment can also play a role in nerve regeneration. Neural stem
cells (NSCs), however, are able to differentiate into many different
types of nerve cells. This is one way that nerves can "repair"
themselves. NSC transplant into damaged areas usually leads to the
cells differentiating into astrocytes which assists the surrounding
neurons. Schwann cells have the ability to regenerate, but the
capacity that these cells can repair nerve cells declines as time goes
on as well as distance the Schwann cells are from site of
damage.[10][11][12][13]
