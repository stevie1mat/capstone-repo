A typical myelinated axon
Axon
An axon (from Greek axon axon, axis) or nerve fiber (or nerve fibre: see spelling
differences) is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, in vertebrates, that
typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the nerve
cell body. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons,
muscles, and glands. In certain sensory neurons (pseudounipolar neurons), such as
those for touch and warmth, the axons are called afferent nerve fibers and the electrical
impulse travels along these from the periphery to the cell body and from the cell body
to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. Axon dysfunction can be the
cause of many inherited and acquired neurological disorders that affect both the
peripheral and central neurons. Nerve fibers are classed into three types  - group A
nerve fibers, group B nerve fibers, and group C nerve fibers. Groups A and B are
myelinated, and group C are unmyelinated. These groups include both sensory fibers
and motor fibers. Another classification groups only the sensory fibers as Type I, Type
II, Type III, and Type IV.
An axon is one of two types of cytoplasmic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron;
the other type is a dendrite. Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features,
including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius),
length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can
be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them).
Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. In some
species, axons can emanate from dendrites known as axon-carrying dendrites.[1] No neuron ever has more than one axon; however
in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of
each other.[2]
Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. Most axons branch, in
some cases very profusely. The end branches of an axon are called telodendria. The swollen end of a telodendron is known as the
axon terminal which joins the dendrite or cell body of another neuron forming a synaptic connection. Axons make contact with
other cells - usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells - at junctions called synapses. In some circumstances, the
axon of one neuron may form a synapse with the dendrites of the same neuron, resulting in an autapse. At a synapse, the membrane
of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or
electrochemical signals across the gap. Some synaptic junctions appear along the length of an axon as it extends; these are called en
passant (""in passing"") synapses and can be in the hundreds or even the thousands along one axon.[3] Other synapses appear as
terminals at the ends of axonal branches.
A single axon, with all its branches taken together, can target multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic
terminals. A bundle of axons make a nerve tract in the central nervous system,[4] and a fascicle in the peripheral nervous system. In
placental mammals the largest white matter tract in the brain is the corpus callosum, formed of some 200 million axons in the human
brain.[4]
Axons are the primary transmission lines of the nervous system, and as bundles they form
nerves. Some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one
millimeter. The longest axons in the human body are those of the sciatic nerve, which run
from the base of the spinal cord to the big toe of each foot. The diameter of axons is also
variable. Most individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about one
micrometer (mm) across). The largest mammalian axons can reach a diameter of up to
20 mm. The squid giant axon, which is specialized to conduct signals very rapidly, is close
to 1 millimeter in diameter, the size of a small pencil lead. The numbers of axonal
telodendria (the branching structures at the end of the axon) can also differ from one nerve
fiber to the next. Axons in the central nervous system (CNS) typically show multiple telodendria, with many synaptic end points. In

comparison, the cerebellar granule cell axon is characterized by a single T-shaped branch
node from which two parallel fibers extend. Elaborate branching allows for the
simultaneous transmission of messages to a large number of target neurons within a single
region of the brain.
There are two types of axons in the nervous system: myelinated and unmyelinated axons.[5]
Myelin is a layer of a fatty insulating substance, which is formed by two types of glial cells:
Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system Schwann cells form
the myelin sheath of a myelinated axon. Oligodendrocytes form the insulating myelin in the
CNS. Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the myelin sheath known as nodes of Ranvier
occur at evenly spaced intervals. The myelination enables an especially rapid mode of
electrical impulse propagation called saltatory conduction.
The myelinated axons from the cortical neurons form the bulk of the neural tissue called white matter in the brain. The myelin gives
the white appearance to the tissue in contrast to the grey matter of the cerebral cortex which contains the neuronal cell bodies. A
similar arrangement is seen in the cerebellum. Bundles of myelinated axons make up the nerve tracts in the CNS. Where these tracts
cross the midline of the brain to connect opposite regions they are called commissures. The largest of these is the corpus callosum
that connects the two cerebral hemispheres, and this has around 20 million axons.[4]
The structure of a neuron is seen to consist of two separate functional regions, or compartments - the cell body together with the
dendrites as one region, and the axonal region as the other.
The axonal region or compartment, includes the axon hillock, the initial segment, the rest of the axon, and the axon telodendria, and
axon terminals. It also includes the myelin sheath. The Nissl bodies that produce the neuronal proteins are absent in the axonal
region.[3] Proteins needed for the growth of the axon, and the removal of waste materials, need a framework for transport. This
axonal transport is provided for in the axoplasm by arrangements of microtubules and intermediate filaments known as
neurofilaments.
The axon hillock is the area formed from the cell body of the
neuron as it extends to become the axon. It precedes the initial
segment. The received action potentials that are summed in the
neuron are transmitted to the axon hillock for the generation of
an action potential from the initial segment.
The axonal initial segment (AIS) is a structurally and
functionally separate microdomain of the axon.[6][7] One
function of the initial segment is to separate the main part of an
axon from the rest of the neuron; another function is to help
initiate action potentials.[8] Both of these functions support
neuron cell polarity, in which dendrites (and, in some cases the
soma) of a neuron receive input signals at the basal region, and at the apical region the neuron's axon provides output signals.[9]
The axon initial segment is unmyelinated and contains a specialized complex of proteins. It is between approximately 20 and 60 mm
in length and functions as the site of action potential initiation.[10][11] Both the position on the axon and the length of the AIS can
change showing a degree of plasticity that can fine-tune the neuronal output.[10][12] A longer AIS is associated with a greater
excitability.[12] Plasticity is also seen in the ability of the AIS to change its distribution and to maintain the activity of neural circuitry
at a constant level.[13]

The AIS is highly specialized for the fast conduction of nerve impulses. This is achieved by a high concentration of voltage-gated
sodium channels in the initial segment where the action potential is initiated.[13] The ion channels are accompanied by a high
number of cell adhesion molecules and scaffold proteins that anchor them to the cytoskeleton.[10] Interactions with ankyrin-G are
important as it is the major organizer in the AIS.[10]
The axoplasm is the equivalent of cytoplasm in the cell. Microtubules form in the axoplasm at the axon hillock. They are arranged
along the length of the axon, in overlapping sections, and all point in the same direction - towards the axon terminals.[14] This is
noted by the positive endings of the microtubules. This overlapping arrangement provides the routes for the transport of different
materials from the cell body.[14] Studies on the axoplasm has shown the movement of numerous vesicles of all sizes to be seen
along cytoskeletal filaments - the microtubules, and neurofilaments, in both directions between the axon and its terminals and the
cell body.
Outgoing anterograde transport from the cell body along the axon, carries mitochondria and membrane proteins needed for growth
to the axon terminal. Ingoing retrograde transport carries cell waste materials from the axon terminal to the cell body.[15] Outgoing
and ingoing tracks use different sets of motor proteins.[14] Outgoing transport is provided by kinesin, and ingoing return traffic is
provided by dynein. Dynein is minus-end directed.[15] There are many forms of kinesin and dynein motor proteins, and each is
thought to carry a different cargo.[14] The studies on transport in the axon led to the naming of kinesin.[14]
In the nervous system, axons may be myelinated, or
unmyelinated. This is the provision of an insulating layer,
called a myelin sheath. The myelin membrane is unique in
its relatively high lipid to protein ratio.[16]
In the peripheral nervous system axons are myelinated by
glial cells known as Schwann cells. In the central nervous
system the myelin sheath is provided by another type of
glial cell, the oligodendrocyte. Schwann cells myelinate a
single axon. An oligodendrocyte can myelinate up to 50
axons.[17]
The composition of myelin is different in the two types. In
the CNS the major myelin protein is proteolipid protein, and
in the PNS it is myelin basic protein.
Nodes of Ranvier (also known as myelin sheath gaps) are short unmyelinated segments of a myelinated axon, which are found
periodically interspersed between segments of the myelin sheath. Therefore, at the point of the node of Ranvier, the axon is reduced
in diameter.[18] These nodes are areas where action potentials can be generated. In saltatory conduction, electrical currents produced
at each node of Ranvier are conducted with little attenuation to the next node in line, where they remain strong enough to generate
another action potential. Thus in a myelinated axon, action potentials effectively ""jump"" from node to node, bypassing the
myelinated stretches in between, resulting in a propagation speed much faster than even the fastest unmyelinated axon can sustain.
An axon can divide into many branches called telodendria (Greek for 'end of tree'). At the end of each telodendron is an axon
terminal (also called a synaptic bouton, or terminal bouton). Axon terminals contain synaptic vesicles that store the neurotransmitter
for release at the synapse. This makes multiple synaptic connections with other neurons possible. Sometimes the axon of a neuron
may synapse onto dendrites of the same neuron, when it is known as an autapse.

Axonal varicosities
Structure of a typical chemical synapse
In the normally developed brain, along the shaft of some axons are located pre-synaptic boutons also known as axonal varicosities
and these have been found in regions of the hippocampus that function in the release of neurotransmitters.[19] However, axonal
varicosities are also present in neurodegenerative diseases where they interfere with the conduction of an action potential. Axonal
varicosities are also the hallmark of traumatic brain injuries.[19][20] Axonal damage is usually to the axon cytoskeleton disrupting
transport. As a consequence protein accumulations such as amyloid-beta precursor protein can build up in a swelling resulting in a
number of varicosities along the axon.[19][20]
Most axons carry signals in the form of action potentials,
which are discrete electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly
along an axon, starting at the cell body and terminating at
points where the axon makes synaptic contact with target cells.
The defining characteristic of an action potential is that it is
""all-or-nothing"" - every action potential that an axon generates
has essentially the same size and shape. This all-or-nothing
characteristic allows action potentials to be transmitted from
one end of a long axon to the other without any reduction in
size. There are, however, some types of neurons with short
axons that carry graded electrochemical signals, of variable
amplitude.
When an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal, it
activates the synaptic transmission process. The first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon,
allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration causes
synaptic vesicles (tiny containers enclosed by a lipid membrane) filled with a neurotransmitter chemical to fuse with the axon's
membrane and empty their contents into the extracellular space. The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic nerve through
exocytosis. The neurotransmitter chemical then diffuses across to receptors located on the membrane of the target cell. The
neurotransmitter binds to these receptors and activates them. Depending on the type of receptors that are activated, the effect on the
target cell can be to excite the target cell, inhibit it, or alter its metabolism in some way. This entire sequence of events often takes
place in less than a thousandth of a second. Afterward, inside the presynaptic terminal, a new set of vesicles is moved into position
next to the membrane, ready to be released when the next action potential arrives. The action potential is the final electrical step in
the integration of synaptic messages at the scale of the neuron.[5]
Extracellular recordings of action potential propagation in axons has been demonstrated in freely moving animals. While
extracellular somatic action potentials have been used to study cellular activity in freely moving animals such as place cells, axonal
activity in both white and gray matter can also be recorded. Extracellular recordings of axon action potential propagation is distinct
from somatic action potentials in three ways: 1. The signal has a shorter peak-trough duration (~150ms) than of pyramidal cells
(~500ms) or interneurons (~250ms). 2. The voltage change is triphasic. 3. Activity recorded on a tetrode is seen on only one of the
four recording wires. In recordings from freely moving rats, axonal signals have been isolated in white matter tracts including the
alveus and the corpus callosum as well hippocampal gray matter.[21]
In fact, the generation of action potentials in vivo is sequential in nature, and these sequential spikes constitute the digital codes in
the neurons. Although previous studies indicate an axonal origin of a single spike evoked by short-term pulses, physiological
signals in vivo trigger the initiation of sequential spikes at the cell bodies of the neurons.[22][23]
In addition to propagating action potentials to axonal terminals, the axon is able to amplify the action potentials, which makes sure a
secure propagation of sequential action potentials toward the axonal terminal. In terms of molecular mechanisms, voltage-gated
sodium channels in the axons possess lower threshold and shorter refractory period in response to short-term pulses.[24]
The development of the axon to its target, is one of the six major stages in the overall development of the nervous system.[25]
Studies done on cultured hippocampal neurons suggest that neurons initially produce multiple neurites that are equivalent, yet only
one of these neurites is destined to become the axon.[26] It is unclear whether axon specification precedes axon elongation or vice

versa,[27] although recent evidence points to the latter. If an axon that is not fully developed
is cut, the polarity can change and other neurites can potentially become the axon. This
alteration of polarity only occurs when the axon is cut at least 10 mm shorter than the other
neurites. After the incision is made, the longest neurite will become the future axon and all
the other neurites, including the original axon, will turn into dendrites.[28] Imposing an
external force on a neurite, causing it to elongate, will make it become an axon.[29]
Nonetheless, axonal development is achieved through a complex interplay between
extracellular signaling, intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics.
The extracellular signals that propagate through the extracellular matrix surrounding
neurons play a prominent role in axonal development.[30] These signaling molecules
include proteins, neurotrophic factors, and extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules.
Netrin (also known as UNC-6) a secreted protein, functions in axon formation. When the
UNC-5 netrin receptor is mutated, several neurites are irregularly projected out of neurons
and finally a single axon is extended anteriorly.[31][32][33][34] The neurotrophic factors -
nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3
(NTF3) are also involved in axon development and bind to Trk receptors.[35]
The ganglioside-converting enzyme plasma membrane ganglioside sialidase (PMGS),
which is involved in the activation of TrkA at the tip of neutrites, is required for the
elongation of axons. PMGS asymmetrically distributes to the tip of the neurite that is
destined to become the future axon.[36]
During axonal development, the activity of PI3K is increased at the tip of destined axon. Disrupting the activity of PI3K inhibits
axonal development. Activation of PI3K results in the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns) which can
cause significant elongation of a neurite, converting it into an axon. As such, the overexpression of phosphatases that
dephosphorylate PtdIns leads into the failure of polarization.[30]
The neurite with the lowest actin filament content will become the axon. PGMS concentration and f-actin content are inversely
correlated; when PGMS becomes enriched at the tip of a neurite, its f-actin content is substantially decreased.[36] In addition,
exposure to actin-depolimerizing drugs and toxin B (which inactivates Rho-signaling) causes the formation of multiple axons.
Consequently, the interruption of the actin network in a growth cone will promote its neurite to become the axon.[37]
Growing axons move through their environment via the growth cone, which is at the tip of the
axon. The growth cone has a broad sheet-like extension called a lamellipodium which contain
protrusions called filopodia. The filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres
to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment. Actin plays a major role in the mobility of
this system. Environments with high levels of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) create an ideal
environment for axonal growth. This seems to provide a ""sticky"" surface for axons to grow along.
Examples of CAMs specific to neural systems include N-CAM, TAG-1  - an axonal
glycoprotein[38] - and MAG, all of which are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Another set
of molecules called extracellular matrix-adhesion molecules also provide a sticky substrate for
axons to grow along. Examples of these molecules include laminin, fibronectin, tenascin, and
perlecan. Some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or
repellents. Others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects.
Cells called guidepost cells assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth. These cells that help
axon guidance, are typically other neurons that are sometimes immature. When the axon has
completed its growth at its connection to the target, the diameter of the axon can increase by up to
five times, depending on the speed of conduction required.[39]

It has also been discovered through research that if the axons of a neuron were damaged, as long as the soma (the cell body of a
neuron) is not damaged, the axons would regenerate and remake the synaptic connections with neurons with the help of guidepost
cells. This is also referred to as neuroregeneration.[40]
Nogo-A is a type of neurite outgrowth inhibitory component that is present in the central nervous system myelin membranes (found
in an axon). It has a crucial role in restricting axonal regeneration in adult mammalian central nervous system. In recent studies, if
Nogo-A is blocked and neutralized, it is possible to induce long-distance axonal regeneration which leads to enhancement of
functional recovery in rats and mouse spinal cord. This has yet to be done on humans.[41] A recent study has also found that
macrophages activated through a specific inflammatory pathway activated by the Dectin-1 receptor are capable of promoting axon
recovery, also however causing neurotoxicity in the neuron.[42]
Axons vary largely in length from a few micrometers up to meters in some animals. This emphasizes that there must be a cellular
length regulation mechanism allowing the neurons both to sense the length of their axons and to control their growth accordingly. It
was discovered that motor proteins play an important role in regulating the length of axons.[43] Based on this observation,
researchers developed an explicit model for axonal growth describing how motor proteins could affect the axon length on the
molecular level.[44][45][46][47] These studies suggest that motor proteins carry signaling molecules from the soma to the growth
cone and vice versa whose concentration oscillates in time with a length-dependent frequency.
The axons of neurons in the human peripheral nervous system can be classified based on their physical features and signal
conduction properties. Axons were known to have different thicknesses (from 0.1 to 20 mm)[3] and these differences were thought
to relate to the speed at which an action potential could travel along the axon - its conductance velocity. Erlanger and Gasser
proved this hypothesis, and identified several types of nerve fiber, establishing a relationship between the diameter of an axon and
its nerve conduction velocity. They published their findings in 1941 giving the first classification of axons.
Axons are classified in two systems. The first one introduced by Erlanger and Gasser, grouped the fibers into three main groups
using the letters A, B, and C. These groups, group A, group B, and group C include both the sensory fibers (afferents) and the
motor fibers (efferents). The first group A, was subdivided into alpha, beta, gamma, and delta fibers - Aa, Ab, Ag, and Ad. The
motor neurons of the different motor fibers, were the lower motor neurons - alpha motor neuron, beta motor neuron, and gamma
motor neuron having the Aa, Ab, and Ag nerve fibers, respectively.
Later findings by other researchers identified two groups of Aa fibers that were sensory fibers. These were then introduced into a
system (Lloyd classification) that only included sensory fibers (though some of these were mixed nerves and were also motor
fibers). This system refers to the sensory groups as Types and uses Roman numerals: Type Ia, Type Ib, Type II, Type III, and Type
IV.

In order of degree of severity, injury to a nerve in the peripheral nervous system can be described as neurapraxia, axonotmesis, or
neurotmesis. Concussion is considered a mild form of diffuse axonal injury.[51] Axonal injury can also cause central chromatolysis.
The dysfunction of axons in the nervous system is one of the major causes of many inherited and acquired neurological disorders
that affect both peripheral and central neurons.[5]
When an axon is crushed, an active process of axonal degeneration takes place at the part of the axon furthest from the cell body.
This degeneration takes place quickly following the injury, with the part of the axon being sealed off at the membranes and broken
down by macrophages. This is known as Wallerian degeneration.[52] Dying back of an axon can also take place in many
neurodegenerative diseases, particularly when axonal transport is impaired, this is known as Wallerian-like degeneration.[53] Studies
suggest that the degeneration happens as a result of the axonal protein NMNAT2, being prevented from reaching all of the axon.[54]
Demyelination of axons causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease multiple sclerosis.
Dysmyelination is the abnormal formation of the myelin sheath. This is implicated in several leukodystrophies, and also in
schizophrenia.[55][56][57]
A severe traumatic brain injury can result in widespread lesions to nerve tracts damaging the axons in a condition known as diffuse
axonal injury. This can lead to a persistent vegetative state.[58] It has been shown in studies on the rat that axonal damage from a
single mild traumatic brain injury, can leave a susceptibility to further damage, after repeated mild traumatic brain injuries.[59]

Clinical significance
A nerve guidance conduit is an artificial means of guiding axon growth to enable neuroregeneration, and is one of the many
treatments used for different kinds of nerve injury.
Some general dictionaries define ""nerve fiber"" as any neuronal process, including both axons and dendrites.[60][61] However,
medical sources generally use ""nerve fiber"" to refer to the axon only.[62][63]
German anatomist Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters is generally credited with the discovery of the axon by distinguishing it from the
dendrites.[5] Swiss Rudolf Albert von Kolliker and German Robert Remak were the first to identify and characterize the axon initial
segment. Kolliker named the axon in 1896.[64] Louis-Antoine Ranvier was the first to describe the gaps or nodes found on axons
and for this contribution these axonal features are now commonly referred to as the nodes of Ranvier. Santiago Ramon y Cajal, a
Spanish anatomist, proposed that axons were the output components of neurons, describing their functionality.[5] Joseph Erlanger
and Herbert Gasser earlier developed the classification system for peripheral nerve fibers,[65] based on axonal conduction velocity,
myelination, fiber size etc. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley also employed the squid giant axon (1939) and by 1952 they had
obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the action potential, leading to the formulation of the Hodgkin-Huxley
model. Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded jointly the Nobel Prize for this work in 1963. The formulae detailing axonal
conductance were extended to vertebrates in the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations. The understanding of the biochemical basis for
action potential propagation has advanced further, and includes many details about individual ion channels.
The axons in invertebrates have been extensively studied. The longfin inshore squid, often used as a model organism has the
longest known axon.[66] The giant squid has the largest axon known. Its size ranges from 0.5 (typically) to 1 mm in diameter and is
used in the control of its jet propulsion system. The fastest recorded conduction speed of 210 m/s, is found in the ensheathed axons
of some pelagic Penaeid shrimps[67] and the usual range is between 90 and 200  meters/s[68] (cf 100-120  m/s for the fastest
myelinated vertebrate axon.)
In other cases as seen in rat studies an axon originates from a dendrite; such axons are said to have ""dendritic origin"". Some axons
with dendritic origin similarly have a ""proximal"" initial segment that starts directly at the axon origin, while others have a ""distal""
initial segment, discernibly separated from the axon origin.[69] In many species some of the neurons have axons that emanate from
the dendrite and not from the cell body, and these are known as axon-carrying dendrites.[1] In many cases, an axon originates at an
axon hillock on the soma; such axons are said to have ""somatic origin"". Some axons with somatic origin have a ""proximal"" initial
segment adjacent the axon hillock, while others have a ""distal"" initial segment, separated from the soma by an extended axon
hillock.[69]

Axon terminal
Axon terminals (also called synaptic boutons, presynaptic
terminals, or end-feet) are distal terminations of the branches
of an axon. An axon, also called a nerve fiber, is a long,
slender projection of a nerve cell that conducts electrical
impulses called action potentials away from the neuron's cell
body to transmit those impulses to other neurons, muscle cells,
or glands. Most presynaptic terminals in the central nervous
system are formed along the axons (en-passant boutons), not
at their ends (terminal boutons).
Functionally, the axon terminal converts an electrical signal
into a chemical signal. When an action potential arrives at an
axon terminal (A), the neurotransmitter is released and
diffuses across the synaptic cleft. If the postsynaptic cell (B) is
also a neuron, neurotransmitter receptors generate a small
electrical current that changes the postsynaptic potential. If the
postsynaptic cell (B) is a muscle cell (neuromuscular junction),
it contracts.
Axon terminals are specialized to release neurotransmitters
very rapidly by exocytosis.[1] Neurotransmitter molecules are
packaged into synaptic vesicles that cluster beneath the axon
terminal membrane on the presynaptic side (A) of a synapse.
Some of these vesicles are docked, i.e., connected to the
membrane by several specialized proteins, such as the SNARE
complex. The incoming action potential activates voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to an influx of
calcium ions into the axon terminal. The SNARE complex reacts to these calcium ions. It forces the
vesicle's membrane to fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing their content into the synaptic cleft
within 180 ms of calcium entry.[2][3][4] When receptors in the postsynaptic membrane bind this
neurotransmitter and open ion channels, information is transmitted between neurons (A) and neurons (B).[5]
To generate an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, many excitatory synapses must be active at the
same time.[1]
Historically, calcium-sensitive dyes were the first tool to quantify the calcium influx into synaptic terminals
and to investigate the mechanisms of short-term plasticity.[6] The process of exocytosis can be visualized
with pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (Synapto-pHluorin): Before release, vesicles are acidic, and the
fluorescence is quenched. Upon release, they are neutralized, generating a brief flash of green
fluorescence.[7] Another possibility is constructing a genetically encoded sensor that becomes fluorescent

synapses.[9]

Anatomical terminology
Brain
The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous
system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. It
consists of nervous tissue and is typically located in the head
(cephalization), usually near organs for special senses such as
vision, hearing and olfaction. Being the most specialized organ,
it is responsible for receiving information from the sensory
nervous system, processing those information (thought,
cognition, and intelligence) and the coordination of motor
control (muscle activity and endocrine system).
While invertebrate brains arise from paired segmental ganglia
(each of which is only responsible for the respective body
segment) of the ventral nerve cord, vertebrate brains develop
axially from the midline dorsal nerve cord as a vesicular
enlargement at the rostral end of the neural tube, with
centralized control over all body segments. All vertebrate brains
can be embryonically divided into three parts: the forebrain
(prosencephalon, 
subdivided 
into 
telencephalon 
and
diencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain
(rhombencephalon, 
subdivided 
into 
metencephalon 
and
myelencephalon). The spinal cord, which directly interacts with
somatic functions below the head, can be considered a caudal
extension of the myelencephalon enclosed inside the vertebral
column. Together, the brain and spinal cord constitute the
central nervous system in all vertebrates.
In humans, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14-16
billion neurons,[1] and the estimated number of neurons in the
cerebellum is 55-70 billion.[2] Each neuron is connected by
synapses to several thousand other neurons, typically
communicating with one another via root-like protrusions called
dendrites and long fiber-like extensions called axons, which are
usually myelinated and carry trains of rapid micro-electric
signal pulses called action potentials to target specific recipient
cells in other areas of the brain or distant parts of the body. The
prefrontal cortex, which controls executive functions, is
particularly well developed in humans.
Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's
other organs. They act on the rest of the body both by
generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the

secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to
changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the
spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex
sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.
The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they
cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.[3] Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the
brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from a digital computer, but similar in the sense
that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.
This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest
attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The
ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. Several
topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a
human context. The most important that are covered in the human brain article are brain disease and the
effects of brain damage.
The shape and size of the brain varies greatly between
species, and identifying common features is often difficult.[4]
Nevertheless, there are a number of principles of brain
architecture that apply across a wide range of species.[5]
Some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the
entire range of animal species;[6] others distinguish
""advanced"" brains from more primitive ones, or distinguish
vertebrates from invertebrates.[4]
The simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is
by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques
have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too
soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in
alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for
examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with
a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by
staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of
molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue
using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.[7]
The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Glial
cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions,
including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons,
however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain.[8] The property that makes neurons
unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances.[8] They send these signals
by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects,
usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or
Structure
Cellular structure
Neurons generate electrical signals that
travel along their axons. When a pulse of
electricity reaches a junction called a
synapse, it causes a neurotransmitter
chemical to be released, which binds to
receptors on other cells and thereby alters
their electrical activity.
body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for
example, if a pyramidal cell (an excitatory neuron) of the
cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became
the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would
become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending
more than a kilometer.[9] These axons transmit signals in the
form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which
last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the
axon at speeds of 1-100 meters per second. Some neurons
emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10-100 per
second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet
most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action
potentials.[10]
Axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of
specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may
make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with
other cells.[8] When an action potential, traveling along an
axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a
neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to
receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.[8]
Synapses are the key functional elements of the brain.[11]
The 
essential 
function 
of 
the 
brain 
is 
cell-to-cell
communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been
estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses;[12] even the brain of a fruit fly contains several
million.[13] The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell);
others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal
chemistry of their target cells in complex ways.[11] A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable;
that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass
through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary
mechanism for learning and memory.[11]
Most of the space in the brain is taken up by axons, which are often bundled together in what are called
nerve fiber tracts. A myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of myelin, which serves to
greatly increase the speed of signal propagation. (There are also unmyelinated axons). Myelin is white,
making parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as light-colored white matter, in contrast
to the darker-colored grey matter that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies.[8]
Except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges (which have no nervous system)[14] and cnidarians
(which have a diffuse nervous system consisting of a nerve net),[14] all living multicellular animals are
bilaterians, meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body plan (that is, left and right sides that are
approximate mirror images of each other).[15] All bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common

ancestor that appeared late in the Cryogenian period,
700-650 million years ago, and it has been
hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape
of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body.[15] At a
schematic level, that basic worm-shape continues to be
reflected in the body and nervous system architecture
of all modern bilaterians, including vertebrates.[16] The
fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a
hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus,
and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion
at the front, called the brain. The brain is small and simple in some species, such as nematode worms; in
other species, such as vertebrates, it is a large and very complex organ.[4] Some types of worms, such as
leeches, also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord, known as a ""tail brain"".[17]
There are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain, including echinoderms and
tunicates. It has not been definitively established whether the existence of these brainless species indicates
that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain, or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the
disappearance of a previously existing brain structure.
This category includes tardigrades, arthropods, molluscs, and
numerous types of worms. The diversity of invertebrate body plans
is matched by an equal diversity in brain structures.[18]
Two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains:
arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others), and
cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and similar molluscs).[19] The
brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve
cords that extend through the body of the animal. Arthropods have
a central brain, the supraesophageal ganglion, with three divisions
and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing.[19]
Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains
of any invertebrates.[20]
There are several invertebrate species whose brains have been studied intensively because they have
properties that make them convenient for experimental work:
Fruit flies (Drosophila), because of the large array of techniques available for studying their
genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development.[21]
In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of
Drosophila neurogenetics have been shown to be relevant to humans. The first biological
clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed
disrupted daily activity cycles.[22] A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of
analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock--and
therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well.[23] Studies done on
Drosophila, also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized
throughout life in response to specific living conditions.[24]
Invertebrates
The brain of a shark
The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, has been studied largely
because of its importance in genetics.[25] In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a
model organism for studying the way that genes control development. One of the advantages
of working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the
hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical
synaptic connections in every worm.[26] Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of
ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually
matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire
body.[27] The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans - its connectome was
achieved.[28] Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and
the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not
been possible.[29]
The sea slug Aplysia californica was chosen by Nobel Prize-winning neurophysiologist Eric
Kandel as a model for studying the cellular basis of learning and memory, because of the
simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system, and it has been examined in hundreds of
experiments.[30]
The first vertebrates appeared over 500 million years ago (Mya), during the
Cambrian period, and may have resembled the modern hagfish in form.[31]
Jawed fish appeared by 445 Mya, amphibians by 350 Mya, reptiles by 310
Mya and mammals by 200  Mya (approximately). Each species has an
equally long evolutionary history, but the brains of modern hagfishes,
lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of
size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of
these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components, but many
are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the
telencephalon) is greatly elaborated and expanded.[32]
Brains are most commonly compared in terms of their size. The relationship
between brain size, body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate
species. As a rule, brain size increases with body size, but not in a simple linear proportion. In general,
smaller animals tend to have larger brains, measured as a fraction of body size. For mammals, the
relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of
about 0.75.[33] This formula describes the central tendency, but every family of mammals departs from it to
some degree, in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior. For example, primates have
brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts. Predators tend to have larger brains than their prey,
relative to body size.[34]
All vertebrate brains share a common underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of
embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at the front end of the
neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon,
mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three
areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts
remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts,
and the midbrain becomes very small.[8]

vertebrate brain, shown for shark and
human. The same parts are present,
but they differ greatly in size and
shape.
The brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue.[8] Living
brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the
inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are
surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called
meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels
enter the central nervous system through holes in the
meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined
tightly to one another, forming the blood-brain barrier, which
blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens[35] (though
at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby
presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the
brain).[36]
Neuroanatomists usually divide the vertebrate brain into six
main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres),
diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla
oblongata. Each of these areas has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and
the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other
parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of
distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural
structure, chemistry, and connectivity.[8]
Although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate
brains, some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial
distortions of brain geometry, especially in the forebrain area. The
brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward
way, but in teleost fishes (the great majority of existing fish species),
the forebrain has become ""everted"", like a sock turned inside out. In
birds, there are also major changes in forebrain structure.[37] These
distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from
one species with those of another species.[38]
Here is a list of some of the most important vertebrate brain
components, along with a brief description of their functions as
currently understood:
The medulla, along with the spinal cord, contains many
small nuclei involved in a wide variety of sensory and
involuntary motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate
and digestive processes.[8]
The pons lies in the brainstem directly above the
medulla. Among other things, it contains nuclei that
control often voluntary but simple acts such as sleep,
respiration, swallowing, bladder function, equilibrium,
eye movement, facial expressions, and posture.[39]
The hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the forebrain, whose complexity and
importance belies its size. It is composed of numerous small nuclei, each with distinct
connections and neurochemistry. The hypothalamus is engaged in additional involuntary or
partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles, eating and drinking, and the release
of some hormones.[40]
The thalamus is a collection of nuclei with diverse functions: some are involved in relaying
information to and from the cerebral hemispheres, while others are involved in motivation.
The subthalamic area (zona incerta) seems to contain action-generating systems for several
types of ""consummatory"" behaviors such as eating, drinking, defecation, and copulation.[41]
The cerebellum modulates the outputs of other brain systems, whether motor-related or
thought related, to make them certain and precise. Removal of the cerebellum does not
prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy.
This precision is not built-in but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned
while riding a bicycle is an example of a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely
within the cerebellum.[8] 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50%
of all neurons are held within its structure.[42]
The optic tectum allows actions to be directed toward points in space, most commonly in
response to visual input. In mammals, it is usually referred to as the superior colliculus, and
its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and
other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other
senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the
thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region
is the largest part of the brain.[43] The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.
The pallium is a layer of grey matter that lies on the surface of the forebrain and is the most
complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ.[44] In reptiles
and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium,
including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate
the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the
cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures
called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the
amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.[45]
The hippocampus, strictly speaking, is found only in mammals. However, the area it derives
from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates. There is evidence that this part
of the brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes,
birds, reptiles, and mammals.[46]
The basal ganglia are a group of interconnected structures in the forebrain. The primary
function of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection: they send inhibitory signals to
all parts of the brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can
release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions.
Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections
within the basal ganglia.[47]
The olfactory bulb is a special structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends
its output to the olfactory part of the pallium. It is a major brain component in many
vertebrates, but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates (whose senses are
dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell).[48]
Modern reptiles and mammals diverged from a common ancestor around 320 million years ago.[49]
Interestingly, the number of extant reptiles far exceeds the number of mammalian species, with 11,733
recognized species of reptiles[50] compared to 5,884 extant mammals.[51] Along with the species diversity,
reptiles have diverged in terms of external morphology, from limbless to tetrapod gliders to armored
chelonians, reflecting adaptive radiation to a diverse array of environments.[52][53]

Morphological differences are reflected
in the nervous system phenotype, such

absence of motor neurons that innervate
trunk muscles in tortoises; presence of
innervation from the trigeminal nerve to
pit organs responsible to infrared
detection in snakes.[52] Variation in size,
weight, and shape of the brain can be
found within reptiles.[54] For instance,
crocodilians have the largest brain
volume to body weight proportion,
followed by turtles, lizards, and snakes.
Reptiles vary in the investment in
different brain sections. Crocodilians
have the largest telencephalon, while
snakes have the smallest. Turtles have

Anatomically, the reptilian brain has less subdivisions than the mammalian brain, however it has numerous
conserved aspects including the organization of the spinal cord and cranial nerve, as well as elaborated
brain pattern of organization.[59] Elaborated brains are characterized by migrated neuronal cell bodies away
Brains of an emu, a kiwi, a barn owl, and a pigeon,

Aside from reptiles and mammals, other vertebrates with elaborated brains include hagfish, galeomorph
sharks, skates, rays, teleosts, and birds.[59] Overall elaborated brains are subdivided in forebrain, midbrain,
and hindbrain.
The hindbrain coordinates and integrates sensory and motor inputs and outputs responsible for, but not
limited to, walking, swimming, or flying. It contains input and output axons interconnecting the spinal cord,
midbrain and forebrain transmitting information from the external and internal environments.[59] The
midbrain links sensory, motor, and integrative components received from the hindbrain, connecting it to the
forebrain. The tectum, which includes the optic tectum and torus semicircularis, receives auditory, visual,
and somatosensory inputs, forming integrated maps of the sensory and visual space around the animal.[59]
The tegmentum receives incoming sensory information and forwards motor responses to and from the
forebrain. The isthmus connects the hindbrain with midbrain. The forebrain region is particularly well
developed, is further divided into diencephalon and telencephalon. Diencephalon is related to regulation of
eye and body movement in response to visual stimuli, sensory information, circadian rhythms, olfactory
input, and autonomic nervous system.Telencephalon is related to control of movements, neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators responsible for integrating inputs and transmitting outputs are present, sensory
systems, and cognitive functions.[59]
The avian brain is the central organ of the nervous
system in birds. Birds possess large, complex brains,
which process, integrate, and coordinate information
received from the environment and make decisions on
how to respond with the rest of the body. Like in all
chordates, the avian brain is contained within the skull
bones of the head.
The bird brain is divided into a number of sections,
each with a different function. The cerebrum or
telencephalon is divided into two hemispheres, and
controls higher functions. The telencephalon is
dominated by a large pallium, which corresponds to
the mammalian cerebral cortex and is responsible for
the cognitive functions of birds. The pallium is made up of several major structures: the hyperpallium, a
dorsal bulge of the pallium found only in birds, as well as the nidopallium, mesopallium, and archipallium.
The bird telencephalon nuclear structure, wherein neurons are distributed in three-dimensionally arranged
clusters, with no large-scale separation of white matter and grey matter, though there exist layer-like and
column-like connections. Structures in the pallium are associated with perception, learning, and cognition.
Beneath the pallium are the two components of the subpallium, the striatum and pallidum. The subpallium
connects different parts of the telencephalon and plays major roles in a number of critical behaviours. To the
rear of the telencephalon are the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum. The hindbrain connects the rest of the
brain to the spinal cord.
The size and structure of the avian brain enables prominent behaviours of birds such as flight and
vocalization. Dedicated structures and pathways integrate the auditory and visual senses, strong in most
species of birds, as well as the typically weaker olfactory and tactile senses. Social behaviour, widespread

among birds, depends on the organisation and functions of the brain. Some birds exhibit strong abilities of
cognition, enabled by the unique structure and physiology of the avian brain.
The most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is their size. On average,
a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large
as that of a reptile of the same body size.[60]
Size, however, is not the only difference: there are also substantial differences in shape. The hindbrain and
midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in
the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure.[61] The cerebral cortex is the part of the
brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum
is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium
evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex.[62] Several areas at the edge of
the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in
mammals than in other vertebrates.[61]
The elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas. The superior colliculus,
which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in
mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex.[60] The
cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral
cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.[63]
The brains of humans and other primates contain the same structures
as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in
proportion to body size.[67] The encephalization quotient (EQ) is
used to compare brain sizes across species. It takes into account the
nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship.[64] Humans have an
average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an
EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those of
primates other than humans,[65] but nearly all other mammals have
EQ values that are substantially lower.
Most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive
expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and
the parts of the cortex involved in vision.[68] The visual processing
network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas,
with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that
visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex.[69] The
prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and
executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and
an especially large fraction of the human brain.[70]

Development
Brain of a human embryo in the sixth week of
development
The brain develops in an intricately orchestrated
sequence of stages.[71] It changes in shape from a
simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the
earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas
and connections. Neurons are created in special zones
that contain stem cells, and then migrate through the
tissue to reach their ultimate locations. Once neurons
have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and
navigate through the brain, branching and extending as
they go, until the tips reach their targets and form
synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the
nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in
excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the
unneeded ones are pruned away.[71]
For vertebrates, the early stages of neural development are similar across all species.[71] As the embryo
transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along
the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The
neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose
the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the
ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the prosencephalon (forebrain),
mesencephalon (midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain). At the next stage, the forebrain splits into
two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related
structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same
time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the
myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative
zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long
distances, to their final positions.[71]
Once a neuron is in place, it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it. Axons, because they
commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a
particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone,
studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to
be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each
point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the
brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses.
Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.[71]
The synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though. In many parts of the
brain, axons initially ""overgrow"", and then are ""pruned"" by mechanisms that depend on neural activity.[71]
In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise
mapping, connecting each point on the surface of the retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer. In
the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the
midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of
midbrain neurons. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of
activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer.
These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time; that is, they
produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons.
This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and
eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell. The result of this
sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult
form.[72]
Similar things happen in other brain areas: an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically
determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven
by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system,
activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist
solely to guide development.[72]
In humans and many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain
contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain.[71] There are, however, a few areas where new
neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well
established are the olfactory bulb, which is involved in the sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the
hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories.
With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present
for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the
lifespan.[73]
There has long been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and intelligence can be
attributed to heredity or to upbringing.[74] Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience shows
that both factors are important. Genes determine both the general form of the brain and how it reacts to
experience, but experience is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, resulting in greatly
increased complexity. The presence or absence of experience is critical at key periods of development.[75]
Additionally, the quantity and quality of experience are important. For example, animals raised in enriched
environments demonstrate thick cerebral cortices, indicating a high density of synaptic connections,
compared to animals with restricted levels of stimulation.[76]
The functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells,
and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells. The electrical
properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes, most notably
the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses.[8]
Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when the local membrane is depolarised and
Ca2+ enters into the cell, typically when an action potential arrives at the synapse - neurotransmitters attach
themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell (or cells), and thereby alter
the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules. With few exceptions, each neuron in the
brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic
connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle.[8] Thus, a neuron can be
Physiology
Neurotransmitters and receptors

characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their
effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine,
heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.[77]
The two neurotransmitters that are most widely found in the vertebrate brain are glutamate, which almost
always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost
always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain.[78]
Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects.
Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative
effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.[79]
There are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain, often
areas dedicated to a particular function. Serotonin, for example--the primary target of many antidepressant
drugs and many dietary aids--comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei.[80]
Norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus
coeruleus.[81] Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the
brain but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.[82]
As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons
for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active.
When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the
electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect
outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG)[83] or
magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with
recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of
animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is
constantly active, even during sleep.[84] Each part of the brain
shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may
vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex
tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha
waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-
looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a
task, called beta and gamma waves. During an epileptic seizure, the
brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical
activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen
in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual
neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.[84]
All vertebrates have a blood-brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from
metabolism in other parts of the body. The neurovascular unit regulates cerebral blood flow so that activated
neurons can be supplied with energy. Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the
chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons, including levels of ions and nutrients.[85]

Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe
metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently
led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats.[86] Most of the brain's energy
consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons.[85] Most vertebrate
species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage
is much higher--in humans it rises to 20-25%.[87] The energy consumption of the brain does not vary
greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive
regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods of PET, fMRI,[88] and NIRS.[89] The
brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar),[85]
but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids
(caprylic and heptanoic acids),[90][91] lactate,[92] acetate,[93] and possibly amino acids.[94]
Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain. There it
is used to determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain
processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of
the environment. Next it combines the processed information with
information about the current needs of the animal and with memory
of past circumstances. Finally, on the basis of the results, it
generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks
require intricate interplay between a variety of functional
subsystems.[95]
The function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the
actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles
to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli
impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts,
and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.[95]
The human brain is provided with information about light, sound,
the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, the
position of the body in space (proprioception), the chemical
composition of the bloodstream, and more. In other animals
additional senses are present, such as the infrared heat-sense of
snakes, the magnetic field sense of some birds, or the electric field
sense mainly seen in aquatic animals.
Each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells,[8] such
as photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive
hair cells in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor
cells travel into the spinal cord or brain, where they transmit their
signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific
sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are
Function
Perception
dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the
cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming
from other sensory systems.[8]
Motor systems are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements, that is, in activating
muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the
voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain.[8]
Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that
descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern
generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the
brain allow for more sophisticated control.[8]
The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor
areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or
swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for
coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of
tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the
subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the
pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of
movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor
areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, basal
ganglia, and cerebellum.[8] In addition to all of the above, the brain and spinal cord contain extensive
circuitry to control the autonomic nervous system which controls the movement of the smooth muscle of the
body.[8]

Many animals alternate between sleeping and waking in a daily cycle. Arousal and alertness are also
modulated on a finer time scale by a network of brain areas.[8] A key component of the sleep system is the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which
Motor control

the optic nerves from the two eyes cross. The SCN contains the body's central biological clock. Neurons
there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, circadian rhythms: these activity
fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of ""clock genes"". The SCN continues to
keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily
receives input from the optic nerves, through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), that allows daily light-
dark cycles to calibrate the clock.[102]
The SCN projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in
implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group
of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to
the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to
the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.[8]
Sleep involves great changes in brain activity.[8] Until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain
essentially shuts off during sleep,[103] but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but
patterns become very different. There are two types of sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-
REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep
episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep
NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of
large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the
neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during
REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.[8]
For any animal, survival requires maintaining a variety of
parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these
include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the
bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and
others.[104] The ability of an animal to regulate the internal
environment of its body--the milieu interieur, as the pioneering
physiologist Claude Bernard called it--is known as homeostasis
(Greek for ""standing still"").[105] Maintaining homeostasis is a
crucial function of the brain. The basic principle that underlies
homeostasis is negative feedback: any time a parameter diverges
from its set-point, sensors generate an error signal that evokes a
response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum
value.[104] (This principle is widely used in engineering, for example in the control of temperature using a
thermostat.)
In vertebrates, the part of the brain that plays the greatest role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base
of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function.[104] The
hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some
of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal
behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors
located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level,
blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas

that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny
gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones
into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.[106]
The individual animals need to express
survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking
food, water, shelter, and a mate.[107] The
motivational system in the brain monitors the
current state of satisfaction of these goals, and
activates behaviors to meet any needs that
arise. The motivational system works largely
by a reward-punishment mechanism. When a
particular behavior is followed by favorable
consequences, the reward mechanism in the
brain is activated, which induces structural
changes inside the brain that cause the same
behavior to be repeated later, whenever a
similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's
punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed
when similar situations arise in the future.[108]
Most organisms studied to date use a reward-punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can
alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers.[109] In vertebrates, the reward-punishment
system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set
of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain.[47] The basal ganglia are the central site at which
decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in
the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is
programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs
that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better
understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very
intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs
such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of
dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.[110]
Almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience--even the most
primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow
correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramon y
Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in
the synaptic connections between neurons.[111] Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the
synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lomo published a paper on a
phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced
synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days.[112] Since then technical advances have made these
sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified

2013, which aims to simulate the

the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a
variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.[113]
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the
process.[114]
Neuroscientists currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by the
brain in distinct ways:
Working memory is the ability of the brain to maintain a temporary representation of
information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in. This sort of dynamic
memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies--groups of activated
neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.[115]
Episodic memory is the ability to remember the details of specific events. This sort of
memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a
crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that
is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.[116]
Semantic memory is the ability to learn facts and relationships. This sort of memory is
probably stored largely in the cerebral cortex, mediated by changes in connections between
cells that represent specific types of information.[117]
Instrumental learning is the ability for rewards and punishments to modify behavior. It is
implemented by a network of brain areas centered on the basal ganglia.[118]
Motor learning is the ability to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or more
generally by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex,
basal ganglia, and especially the cerebellum, which functions as a large memory bank for
microadjustments of the parameters of movement.[119]
The field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to
understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system.[8]
Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology
is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the
nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied
in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent,
and treat mental disorders.[120] Cognitive science seeks to unify
neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern
themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial
intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.[121]
The oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical, and until the
middle of the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience
came from the development of better cell stains and better
microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic
structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora
of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of
immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also,
functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure
with differences in cognition or behavior.[122]

Neurophysiologists study the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain: their primary
tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous
system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either
glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings,
which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons.[123] Because the brain does not contain
pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and
behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity
in human patients with intractable epilepsy, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant
electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures.[124] Functional imaging techniques
such as fMRI are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human
subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they
have the great advantage of being noninvasive.[125]
Another approach to brain function is to examine the
consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even
though it is protected by the skull and meninges,
surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from
the bloodstream by the blood-brain barrier, the delicate
nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous
diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the
effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have
been a key source of information about brain function.
Because there is no ability to experimentally control
the nature of the damage, however, this information is
often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most
commonly involving rats, it is possible to use
electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce
precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.[127]
Computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches: first, the use of computers to study the brain;
second, the study of how brains perform computation. On one hand, it is possible to write a computer
program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that
describe their electrochemical activity; such simulations are known as biologically realistic neural networks.
On the other hand, it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating, or mathematically
analyzing, the operations of simplified ""units"" that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out
much of their biological complexity. The computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer
scientists and neuroscientists.[128]
Computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal
models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes.
Recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brain
[129] and a focus on the roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in neuroplasticity.[114] The most
common subjects are mice, because of the availability of technical tools. It is now possible with relative ease
to ""knock out"" or mutate a wide variety of genes, and then examine the effects on brain function. More
sophisticated approaches are also being used: for example, using Cre-Lox recombination it is possible to
activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of the brain, at specific times.[129]

how the brain implements a reflex

Recent years have also seen rapid advances in single-cell sequencing technologies, and these have been
used to leverage the cellular heterogeneity of the brain as a means of better understanding the roles of
distinct cell types in disease and biology (as well as how genomic variants influence individual cell types).
In 2024, investigators studied a large integrated dataset of almost 3 million nuclei from the human prefrontal
cortext from 388 individuals.[130] In doing so, they annotated 28 cell types to evaluate expression and
chromatin variation across gene families and drug targets. They identified about half a million cell type-
specific regulatory elements and about 1.5 million single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (ie, genomic
variants with strong statistical associations with changes in gene expression within specific cell types),
which were then used to build cell-type regulatory networks (the study also describes cell-to-cell
communication networks). These networks were found to manifest cellular changes in aging and
neuropsychiatric disorders. As part of the same same investigation, a machine learning model was designed
to accurately impute single-cell expression (this model prioritized ~250 disease-risk genes and drug targets
with associated cell types).
The oldest brain to have been discovered was in Armenia in the
Areni-1 cave complex. The brain, estimated to be over 5,000 years
old, was found in the skull of a 12 to 14-year-old girl. Although the
brains were shriveled, they were well preserved due to the climate
found inside the cave.[131]
Early philosophers were divided as to whether the seat of the soul
lies in the brain or heart. Aristotle favored the heart, and thought
that the function of the brain was merely to cool the blood.
Democritus, the inventor of the atomic theory of matter, argued for
a three-part soul, with intellect in the head, emotion in the heart, and
lust near the liver.[132] The unknown author of On the Sacred
Disease, a medical treatise in the Hippocratic Corpus, came down
unequivocally in favor of the brain, writing:
Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain
come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows,
griefs, despondency, and lamentations. ... And by the
same organ we become mad and delirious, and fears and
terrors assail us, some by night, and some by day, and
dreams and untimely wanderings, and cares that are not
suitable, and ignorance of present circumstances,
desuetude, and unskillfulness. All these things we endure
from the brain, when it is not healthy...

Hippocrates[133]
The Roman physician Galen also argued for the importance of the brain, and theorized in some depth about
how it might work. Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles,
demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of

nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying
a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon, usually translated as
""animal spirits"".[132] Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle
Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when
detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical
speculations of Rene Descartes and those who followed him. Descartes,
like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms. He believed
that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical res
cogitans, but that the majority of behaviors of humans, and all behaviors of
animals, could be explained mechanistically.[132]
The first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function,
though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), who
discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a
dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major
advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the
development of a new technique of investigation. Until the early years of
the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells.[134]
Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small
fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such
a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it
is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish
neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each
with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.[135]
In the first half of the 20th century, advances in electronics enabled
investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells, culminating
in work by Alan Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley, and others on the
biophysics of the action potential, and the work of Bernard Katz
and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse.[136] These
studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of
the brain as a dynamic entity. Reflecting the new understanding, in
1942 Charles Sherrington visualized the workings of the brain
waking from sleep:
The great topmost sheet of the mass, that where hardly a
light had twinkled or moved, becomes now a sparkling
field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling
sparks hurrying hither and thither. The brain is waking
and with it the mind is returning. It is as if the Milky Way
entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the head mass
becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing
shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful
pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony
of subpatterns.

Sherrington, 1942, Man on his Nature[137]
The invention of electronic computers in the 1940s, along with the development of mathematical
information theory, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing
systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics, and eventually gave rise to the field now
known as computational neuroscience.[138] The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in
that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von
Neumann's 1958 book, The Computer and the Brain.[139] Over the years, though, accumulating
information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved
theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.[138]
One of the most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled What the frog's eye tells the frog's
brain: the paper examined the visual responses of neurons in the retina and optic tectum of frogs, and came
to the conclusion that some neurons in the tectum of the frog are wired to combine elementary responses in
a way that makes them function as ""bug perceivers"".[140] A few years later David Hubel and Torsten
Wiesel discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move
across specific points in the field of view--a discovery for which they won a Nobel Prize.[141] Follow-up
studies in higher-order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity, color, movement, and aspects
of shape, with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly
complex responses.[142] Other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a
wide variety of response correlates, some related to memory, some to abstract types of cognition such as
space.[143]
Theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of
neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated using computers.[138] Some useful models are
abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are
implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real
neurons.[144] No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function,
though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed
processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively--current methods of brain
activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.[145]
Furthermore, even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations.[146] So,
brain models that do not reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do
try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational
resources. However, the Human Brain Project is trying to build a realistic, detailed computational model of
the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile
scientists on both sides of the argument.
In the second half of the 20th century, developments in chemistry, electron microscopy, genetics, computer
science, functional brain imaging, and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure
and function. In the United States, the 1990s were officially designated as the ""Decade of the Brain"" to
commemorate advances made in brain research, and to promote funding for such research.[147]

In the 21st century, these trends have continued, and several new approaches have come into prominence,
including multielectrode recording, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the
same time;[148] genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered
experimentally;[129] genomics, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in
DNA properties and neuroimaging.[149]
Animal brains are used as food in numerous cuisines.
Some archaeological evidence suggests that the mourning rituals of
European Neanderthals also involved the consumption of the
brain.[150]
The Fore people of Papua New Guinea are known to eat human
brains. In funerary rituals, those close to the dead would eat the
brain of the deceased to create a sense of immortality. A prion
disease called kuru has been traced to this.[151]

Brainstem
The brainstem (or brain stem) is the stalk-like[1]: 
152  part of
the brain that interconnects the cerebrum and diencephalon with
the spinal cord.[2] In the human brain, the brainstem is
composed of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla
oblongata.[3][1]: 
152  The midbrain is continuous with the
thalamus of the diencephalon through the tentorial notch.[1]: 
152 
The brainstem is very small, making up around only 2.6 percent
of the brain's total weight.[1]: 
195  It has the critical roles of
regulating heart and respiratory function, helping to control
heart rate and breathing rate.[4] It also provides the main motor
and sensory nerve supply to the face and neck via the cranial
nerves. Ten pairs of cranial nerves come from the brainstem.[5]
Other roles include the regulation of the central nervous system
and the body's sleep cycle.[4] It is also of prime importance in
the conveyance of motor and sensory pathways from the rest of
the brain to the body, and from the body back to the brain.[4]
These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function),
the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch,
vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic
tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch).[6]
The parts of the brainstem are the midbrain, the pons, and the
medulla oblongata; the diencephalon is sometimes considered
part of the brainstem.[7]: 
248 
The brainstem extends from just above the tentorial notch
superiorly to the first cervical vertebra below the foramen
magnum inferiorly.[3]
The midbrain is further subdivided into three parts: tectum,
tegmentum, and the ventral tegmental area. The tectum forms
the ceiling. The tectum comprises the paired structure of the
superior and inferior colliculi and is the dorsal covering of the
cerebral aqueduct. The inferior colliculus is the principal
midbrain nucleus of the auditory pathway and receives input
from several peripheral brainstem nuclei, as well as inputs from
the auditory cortex. Its inferior brachium (arm-like process)

reaches to the medial geniculate nucleus of the diencephalon.
The superior colliculus is positioned above the inferior
colliculus, and marks the rostral midbrain. It is involved in the
special sense of vision and sends its superior brachium to the
lateral geniculate body of the diencephalon.
The tegmentum which forms the floor of the midbrain, is
ventral to the cerebral aqueduct. Several nuclei, tracts, and the
reticular formation are contained here.
The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is composed of paired
cerebral peduncles. These transmit axons of upper motor
neurons.
The midbrain consists of:
Periaqueductal gray: The area of gray matter
around the cerebral aqueduct contains various
neurons involved in the pain desensitization
pathway. Neurons synapse here. When stimulated
by a signal, the synaptic connections
activate neurons in the nucleus raphe
magnus; the pathway then projects down
into the posterior grey column of the spinal
cord which prevents pain sensation
transmission.
Oculomotor nerve nucleus: This is the third
cranial nerve nucleus.
Trochlear nerve nucleus: This is the fourth
cranial nerve.
Red nucleus: This is a motor nucleus that
sends a descending tract to the lower motor
neurons.
Substantia nigra pars compacta: This is a
concentration of neurons in the ventral
portion of the midbrain that uses dopamine as its
neurotransmitter and is involved in both motor function
and emotion. Its dysfunction is implicated in Parkinson's
disease.
Reticular formation: This is a large area in the midbrain
that is involved in various important functions of the
midbrain. In particular, it contains lower motor neurons, is
involved in the pain desensitization pathway, is involved
in the arousal and consciousness systems, and contains
the locus coeruleus, which is involved in intensive
alertness modulation and in autonomic reflexes.
Central tegmental tract: Directly anterior to the floor of the
fourth ventricle, this is a pathway by which many tracts
project up to the cortex and down to the spinal cord.
Midbrain nuclei
Ventral tegmental area: A dopaminergic nucleus, known as group A10 cells[8] is located
close to the midline on the floor of the midbrain.
Rostromedial tegmental nucleus: A GABAergic nucleus located adjacent to the ventral
tegmental area.

The pons lies between the midbrain and the medulla oblongata. It is separated from the midbrain by the
superior pontine sulcus, and from the medulla by the inferior pontine sulcus.[9] It contains tracts that carry
signals from the cerebrum to the medulla and to the cerebellum and also tracts that carry sensory signals to
the thalamus. The pons is connected to the cerebellum by the cerebellar peduncles. The pons houses the
respiratory pneumotaxic center and apneustic center that make up the pontine respiratory group in the
respiratory center. The pons co-ordinates activities of the cerebellar hemispheres.[10] The pons and medulla
oblongata are parts of the hindbrain that form much of the brainstem.

The medulla oblongata, often just referred to as the medulla, is the lower half of the brainstem continuous
with the spinal cord. Its upper part is continuous with the pons.[7]: 
1121  The medulla contains the cardiac,
dorsal and ventral respiratory groups, and vasomotor centres, dealing with heart rate, breathing and blood
pressure. Another important medullary structure is the area postrema whose functions include the control of
vomiting.

From the front
In the medial part of the medulla is the anterior median fissure.
Moving laterally on each side are the medullary pyramids. The
pyramids contain the fibers of the corticospinal tract (also called the
pyramidal tract), or the upper motor neuronal axons as they head
inferiorly to synapse on lower motor neuronal cell bodies within the
anterior grey column of the spinal cord.
The anterolateral sulcus is lateral to the pyramids. Emerging from
the anterolateral sulci are the CN XII (hypoglossal nerve) rootlets.
Lateral to these rootlets and the anterolateral sulci are the olives.
The olives are swellings in the medulla containing underlying
inferior nucleary nuclei (containing various nuclei and afferent
fibers). Lateral (and dorsal) to the olives are the rootlets for CN IX
(glossopharyngeal), CN X (vagus) and CN XI (accessory nerve). The pyramids end at the pontine medulla
junction, noted most obviously by the large basal pons. From this junction, CN VI (abducens nerve), CN
VII (facial nerve) and CN VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve) emerge. At the level of the midpons, CN V (the
trigeminal nerve) emerges. Cranial nerve III (the oculomotor nerve) emerges ventrally from the midbrain,
while the CN IV (the trochlear nerve) emerges out from the dorsal aspect of the midbrain.
Between the two pyramids can be seen a decussation of fibers which marks the transition from the medulla
to the spinal cord. The medulla is above the decussation and the spinal cord below.
From behind
The most medial part of the medulla is the posterior median sulcus. Moving laterally on each side is the
gracile fasciculus, and lateral to that is the cuneate fasciculus. Superior to each of these, and directly inferior
to the obex, are the gracile and cuneate tubercles, respectively. Underlying these are their respective nuclei.
The obex marks the end of the fourth ventricle and the beginning of the central canal. The posterior
intermediate sulcus separates the gracile fasciculus from the cuneate fasciculus. Lateral to the cuneate
fasciculus is the lateral funiculus.
Appearance
The appearance of a cadaveric
brainstem from behind, with major
parts labelled
The brainstem receives blood via the
vertebral arteries, shown here.
Superior to the obex is the floor of the fourth ventricle. In the floor
of the fourth ventricle, various nuclei can be visualized by the small
bumps that they make in the overlying tissue. In the midline and
directly superior to the obex is the vagal trigone and superior to that
it the hypoglossal trigone. Underlying each of these are motor
nuclei for the respective cranial nerves. Superior to these trigones
are fibers running laterally in both directions. These fibers are
known collectively as the striae medullares. Continuing in a rostral
direction, the large bumps are called the facial colliculi. Each facial
colliculus, contrary to their names, do not contain the facial nerve
nuclei. Instead, they have facial nerve axons traversing superficial
to underlying abducens (CN VI) nuclei. Lateral to all these bumps
previously discussed is an indented line, or sulcus that runs rostrally,
and is known as the sulcus limitans. This separates the medial motor neurons from the lateral sensory
neurons. Lateral to the sulcus limitans is the area of the vestibular system, which is involved in special
sensation. Moving rostrally, the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncles are found connecting the
midbrain to the cerebellum. Directly rostral to the superior cerebellar peduncle, there is the superior
medullary velum and then the two trochlear nerves. This marks the end of the pons as the inferior colliculus
is directly rostral and marks the caudal midbrain. Middle cerebellar peduncle is located inferior and lateral to
the superior cerebellar peduncle, connecting pons to the cerebellum. Likewise, inferior cerebellar peduncle
is found connecting the medulla oblongata to the cerebellum.
The main supply of blood to the brainstem is provided by the
basilar arteries and the vertebral arteries.[11]: 
740 
The human brainstem emerges from two of the three primary brain
vesicles formed of the neural tube. The mesencephalon is the
second of the three primary vesicles, and does not further
differentiate into a secondary brain vesicle. This will become the
midbrain. The third primary vesicle, the rhombencephalon
(hindbrain) will further differentiate into two secondary vesicles, the
metencephalon and the myelencephalon. The metencephalon will
become the cerebellum and the pons. The more caudal
myelencephalon will become the medulla.
The brainstem plays important functions in breathing, heart rate, arousal / consciousness, sleep / wake
functions and attention / concentration.[12]
There are three main functions of the brainstem:
1. The brainstem plays a role in conduction. That is, all information relayed from the body to the
cerebrum and cerebellum and vice versa must traverse the brainstem. The ascending

pathways coming from the body to the brain are the sensory pathways and include the
spinothalamic tract for pain and temperature sensation and the dorsal column-medial
lemniscus pathway (DCML) including the gracile fasciculus and the cuneate fasciculus for
touch, proprioception, and pressure sensation. The facial sensations have similar pathways
and will travel in the spinothalamic tract and the DCML. Descending tracts are the axons of
upper motor neurons destined to synapse on lower motor neurons in the ventral horn and
posterior horn. In addition, there are upper motor neurons that originate in the brainstem's
vestibular, red, tectal, and reticular nuclei, which also descend and synapse in the spinal
cord.
2. The cranial nerves III-XII emerge from the brainstem.[13] These cranial nerves supply the
face, head, and viscera. (The first two pairs of cranial nerves arise from the cerebrum).
3. The brainstem has integrative functions being involved in cardiovascular system control,
respiratory control, pain sensitivity control, alertness, awareness, and consciousness. Thus,
brainstem damage is a very serious and often life-threatening problem.
Ten of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves either target or are sourced
from the brainstem nuclei.[11]: 
725  The nuclei of the oculomotor
nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV) are located in the midbrain. The
nuclei of the trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve
(VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) are located in the pons.
The nuclei of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X),
accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII) are located in the
medulla. The fibers of these cranial nerves exit the brainstem from
these nuclei.[14]
Diseases of the brainstem can result in abnormalities in the function
of cranial nerves that may lead to visual disturbances, pupil
abnormalities, changes in sensation, muscle weakness, hearing
problems, vertigo, swallowing and speech difficulty, voice change,
and co-ordination problems. Localizing neurological lesions in the
brainstem may be very precise, although it relies on a clear
understanding on the functions of brainstem anatomical structures and how to test them.
Brainstem stroke syndrome can cause a range of impairments including locked-in syndrome.
Duret haemorrhages are areas of bleeding in the midbrain and upper pons due to a downward traumatic
displacement of the brainstem.[7]: 
842 
Cysts known as syrinxes can affect the brainstem, in a condition, called syringobulbia. These fluid-filled
cavities can be congenital, acquired or the result of a tumor.
Criteria for claiming brainstem death in the UK have developed in order to make the decision of when to
stop ventilation of somebody who could not otherwise sustain life. These determining factors are that the
patient is irreversibly unconscious and incapable of breathing unaided. All other possible causes must be
ruled out that might otherwise indicate a temporary condition. The state of irreversible brain damage has to

be unequivocal. There are brainstem reflexes that are checked for by two senior doctors so that imaging
technology is unnecessary. The absence of the cough and gag reflexes, of the corneal reflex and the
vestibulo-ocular reflex need to be established; the pupils of the eyes must be fixed and dilated; there must
be an absence of motor response to stimulation and an absence of breathing marked by concentrations of
carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. All of these tests must be repeated after a certain time before death can
be declared.[15]

Anatomical terminology
Central nervous system
The central nervous system (CNS) is the part of the
nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord,
the retina and optic nerve, and the olfactory nerve and
epithelia. The CNS is so named because the brain
integrates the received information and coordinates and
influences the activity of all parts of the bodies of
bilaterally symmetric and triploblastic animals--that is,
all multicellular animals except sponges and diploblasts.
It is a structure composed of nervous tissue positioned
along the rostral (nose end) to caudal (tail end) axis of
the body and may have an enlarged section at the
rostral end which is a brain. Only arthropods,
cephalopods and vertebrates have a true brain, though
precursor structures exist in onychophorans, gastropods
and lancelets.
The rest of this article exclusively discusses the
vertebrate central nervous system, which is radically
distinct from all other animals.
In vertebrates, the brain and spinal cord are both
enclosed in the meninges.[2] The meninges provide a
barrier to chemicals dissolved in the blood, protecting
the brain from most neurotoxins commonly found in
food. Within the meninges the brain and spinal cord are
bathed in cerebral spinal fluid which replaces the body
fluid found outside the cells of all bilateral animals.
In vertebrates, the CNS is contained within the dorsal
body cavity, while the brain is housed in the cranial
cavity within the skull. The spinal cord is housed in the
spinal canal within the vertebrae.[2] Within the CNS,
the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of
supporting non-nervous cells called neuroglia or glia
from the Greek for ""glue"".[3]
In vertebrates, the CNS also includes the retina[4] and
the optic nerve (cranial nerve II),[5][6] as well as the
olfactory nerves and olfactory epithelium.[7] As parts of
the CNS, they connect directly to brain neurons without

intermediate ganglia. The olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue outside the meninges in
direct contact with the environment, which opens up a pathway for therapeutic agents which cannot
otherwise cross the meninges barrier.[7]
The CNS consists of two major structures: the brain and spinal cord. The brain is encased in the skull, and
protected by the cranium.[8] The spinal cord is continuous with the brain and lies caudally to the brain.[9] It
is protected by the vertebrae.[8] The spinal cord reaches from the base of the skull, and continues through[8]
or starting below[10] the foramen magnum,[8] and terminates roughly level with the first or second lumbar
vertebra,[9][10] occupying the upper sections of the vertebral canal.[6]
Microscopically, there are differences between the neurons and
tissue of the CNS and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).[11] The
CNS is composed of white and gray matter.[9] This can also be seen
macroscopically on brain tissue. The white matter consists of axons
and oligodendrocytes, while the gray matter consists of neurons and
unmyelinated fibers. Both tissues include a number of glial cells
(although the white matter contains more), which are often referred
to as supporting cells of the CNS. Different forms of glial cells have
different functions, some acting almost as scaffolding for
neuroblasts to climb during neurogenesis such as bergmann glia,
while others such as microglia are a specialized form of
macrophage, involved in the immune system of the brain as well as
the clearance of various metabolites from the brain tissue.[6] Astrocytes may be involved with both
clearance of metabolites as well as transport of fuel and various beneficial substances to neurons from the
capillaries of the brain. Upon CNS injury astrocytes will proliferate, causing gliosis, a form of neuronal scar
tissue, lacking in functional neurons.[6]
The brain (cerebrum as well as midbrain and hindbrain) consists of a cortex, composed of neuron-bodies
constituting gray matter, while internally there is more white matter that form tracts and commissures. Apart
from cortical gray matter there is also subcortical gray matter making up a large number of different
nuclei.[9]
From and to the spinal cord are projections of the peripheral nervous system in the form of spinal nerves
(sometimes segmental nerves[8]). The nerves connect the spinal cord to skin, joints, muscles etc. and allow
for the transmission of efferent motor as well as afferent sensory signals and stimuli.[9] This allows for
voluntary and involuntary motions of muscles, as well as the perception of senses. All in all 31 spinal nerves
project from the brain stem,[9] some forming plexa as they branch out, such as the brachial plexa, sacral
plexa etc.[8] Each spinal nerve will carry both sensory and motor signals, but the nerves synapse at different
regions of the spinal cord, either from the periphery to sensory relay neurons that relay the information to
the CNS or from the CNS to motor neurons, which relay the information out.[9]

dorsal spinal cord (above in this

lateral) horns of the spinal cord as
seen below in the image.
Different ways in which the CNS can
be activated without engaging the
cortex, and making us aware of the
actions. The above example shows
the process in which the pupil dilates
during dim light, activating neurons in
the spinal cord. The second example
shows the constriction of the pupil as
a result of the activation of the
Eddinger-Westphal nucleus (a
cerebral ganglion).
The spinal cord relays information up to the brain through spinal
tracts through the final common pathway[9] to the thalamus and
ultimately to the cortex.

spinal cord.
 
Reflexes may also
occur without
engaging more than
one neuron of the
CNS as in the below
example of a short
reflex.
Apart from the spinal cord, there are also peripheral nerves of the
PNS that synapse through intermediaries or ganglia directly on the
CNS. These 12 nerves exist in the head and neck region and are
called cranial nerves. Cranial nerves bring information to the CNS
to and from the face, as well as to certain muscles (such as the
trapezius muscle, which is innervated by accessory nerves[8] as well
as certain cervical spinal nerves).[8]
Two pairs of cranial nerves; the olfactory nerves and the optic
nerves[4] are often considered structures of the CNS. This is
because they do not synapse first on peripheral ganglia, but directly
on CNS neurons. The olfactory epithelium is significant in that it
consists of CNS tissue expressed in direct contact to the
environment, allowing for administration of certain pharmaceuticals
and drugs. [7]

At the anterior end of the spinal cord lies the brain.[9] The brain makes up the largest portion of the CNS. It
is often the main structure referred to when speaking of the nervous system in general. The brain is the
major functional unit of the CNS. While the spinal cord has certain processing ability such as that of spinal
locomotion and can process reflexes, the brain is the major processing unit of the nervous system.[12][13]
The brainstem consists of the medulla, the pons and the midbrain. The medulla can be referred to as an
extension of the spinal cord, which both have similar organization and functional properties.[9] The tracts
passing from the spinal cord to the brain pass through here.[9]
Regulatory functions of the medulla nuclei include control of blood pressure and breathing. Other nuclei are
involved in balance, taste, hearing, and control of muscles of the face and neck.[9]
The next structure rostral to the medulla is the pons, which lies on the ventral anterior side of the brainstem.
Nuclei in the pons include pontine nuclei which work with the cerebellum and transmit information
between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex.[9] In the dorsal posterior pons lie nuclei that are involved in
the functions of breathing, sleep, and taste.[9]
The midbrain, or mesencephalon, is situated above and rostral to the pons. It includes nuclei linking distinct
parts of the motor system, including the cerebellum, the basal ganglia and both cerebral hemispheres,
among others. Additionally, parts of the visual and auditory systems are located in the midbrain, including
control of automatic eye movements.[9]
The brainstem at large provides entry and exit to the brain for a number of pathways for motor and
autonomic control of the face and neck through cranial nerves,[9] Autonomic control of the organs is
mediated by the tenth cranial nerve.[6] A large portion of the brainstem is involved in such autonomic
control of the body. Such functions may engage the heart, blood vessels, and pupils, among others.[9]
The brainstem also holds the reticular formation, a group of nuclei involved in both arousal and alertness.[9]
The cerebellum lies behind the pons. The cerebellum is composed of several dividing fissures and lobes. Its
function includes the control of posture and the coordination of movements of parts of the body, including
the eyes and head, as well as the limbs. Further, it is involved in motion that has been learned and perfected

through practice, and it will adapt to new learned movements.[9] Despite its previous classification as a
motor structure, the cerebellum also displays connections to areas of the cerebral cortex involved in
language and cognition. These connections have been shown by the use of medical imaging techniques,
such as functional MRI and Positron emission tomography.[9]
The body of the cerebellum holds more neurons than any other structure of the brain, including that of the
larger cerebrum, but is also more extensively understood than other structures of the brain, as it includes
fewer types of different neurons.[9] It handles and processes sensory stimuli, motor information, as well as
balance information from the vestibular organ.[9]
The two structures of the diencephalon worth noting are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. The thalamus
acts as a linkage between incoming pathways from the peripheral nervous system as well as the optical
nerve (though it does not receive input from the olfactory nerve) to the cerebral hemispheres. Previously it
was considered only a ""relay station"", but it is engaged in the sorting of information that will reach cerebral
hemispheres (neocortex).[9]
Apart from its function of sorting information from the periphery, the thalamus also connects the cerebellum
and basal ganglia with the cerebrum. In common with the aforementioned reticular system the thalamus is
involved in wakefulness and consciousness, such as though the SCN.[9]
The hypothalamus engages in functions of a number of primitive emotions or feelings such as hunger, thirst
and maternal bonding. This is regulated partly through control of secretion of hormones from the pituitary
gland. Additionally the hypothalamus plays a role in motivation and many other behaviors of the
individual.[9]
The cerebrum of cerebral hemispheres make up the largest visual portion of the human brain. Various
structures combine to form the cerebral hemispheres, among others: the cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala and
hippocampus. The hemispheres together control a large portion of the functions of the human brain such as
emotion, memory, perception and motor functions. Apart from this the cerebral hemispheres stand for the
cognitive capabilities of the brain.[9]
Connecting each of the hemispheres is the corpus callosum as well as several additional commissures.[9]
One of the most important parts of the cerebral hemispheres is the cortex, made up of gray matter covering
the surface of the brain. Functionally, the cerebral cortex is involved in planning and carrying out of
everyday tasks.[9]
The hippocampus is involved in storage of memories, the amygdala plays a role in perception and
communication of emotion, while the basal ganglia play a major role in the coordination of voluntary
movement.[9]

Difference from the peripheral nervous system
A map over the different structures of the nervous systems
in the body, showing the CNS, PNS, autonomic nervous
system, and enteric nervous system.
Top image: CNS as seen in a median section of a 5-week-old embryo. Bottom image: CNS seen in a median
section of a 3-month-old embryo.
This differentiates the CNS from the PNS,
which consists of neurons, axons, and
Schwann 
cells. 
Oligodendrocytes 
and
Schwann cells have similar functions in the
CNS and PNS, respectively. Both act to add
myelin sheaths to the axons, which acts as a
form of insulation allowing for better and faster
proliferation of electrical signals along the
nerves. Axons in the CNS are often very short,
barely a few millimeters, and do not need the
same degree of isolation as peripheral nerves.
Some peripheral nerves can be over 1 meter in
length, such as the nerves to the big toe. To
ensure signals move at sufficient speed,
myelination is needed.
The way in which the Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes myelinate nerves differ. A Schwann cell usually
myelinates a single axon, completely surrounding it. Sometimes, they may myelinate many axons,
especially when in areas of short axons.[8] Oligodendrocytes usually myelinate several axons. They do this
by sending out thin projections of their cell membrane, which envelop and enclose the axon.
Development
During early development of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal groove on the neural plate gradually
deepens and the ridges on either side of the groove (the neural folds) become elevated, and ultimately meet,
transforming the groove into a closed tube called the neural tube.[14] The formation of the neural tube is
called neurulation. At this stage, the walls of the neural tube contain proliferating neural stem cells in a
region called the ventricular zone. The neural stem cells, principally radial glial cells, multiply and generate
neurons through the process of neurogenesis, forming the rudiment of the CNS.[15]
The neural tube gives rise to both brain and spinal cord. The anterior (or 'rostral') portion of the neural tube
initially differentiates into three brain vesicles (pockets): the prosencephalon at the front, the
mesencephalon, and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the rhombencephalon. (By six weeks
in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the telencephalon and diencephalon; and
the rhombencephalon divides into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The spinal cord is derived from
the posterior or 'caudal' portion of the neural tube.
As a vertebrate grows, these vesicles differentiate further still. The telencephalon differentiates into, among
other things, the striatum, the hippocampus and the neocortex, and its cavity becomes the first and second
ventricles. Diencephalon elaborations include the subthalamus, hypothalamus, thalamus and epithalamus,
and its cavity forms the third ventricle. The tectum, pretectum, cerebral peduncle and other structures
develop out of the mesencephalon, and its cavity grows into the mesencephalic duct (cerebral aqueduct).
The metencephalon becomes, among other things, the pons and the cerebellum, the myelencephalon forms
the medulla oblongata, and their cavities develop into the fourth ventricle.[9]

Spinal cord
Planarians, members of the phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms), have the simplest, clearly defined
delineation of a nervous system into a CNS and a PNS.[16][17] Their primitive brains, consisting of two
fused anterior ganglia, and longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS. Like vertebrates, have a distinct CNS
and PNS. The nerves projecting laterally from the CNS form their PNS.
A molecular study found that more than 95% of the 116 genes involved in the nervous system of planarians,
which includes genes related to the CNS, also exist in humans.[18]
Evolution
Planaria
Arthropoda
In arthropods, the ventral nerve cord, the subesophageal ganglia and the supraesophageal ganglia are
usually seen as making up the CNS. Arthropoda, unlike vertebrates, have inhibitory motor neurons due to
their small size.[19]
The CNS of chordates differs from that of other animals in being placed dorsally in the body, above the gut
and notochord/spine.[20] The basic pattern of the CNS is highly conserved throughout the different species
of vertebrates and during evolution. The major trend that can be observed is towards a progressive
telencephalisation: the telencephalon of reptiles is only an appendix to the large olfactory bulb, while in
mammals it makes up most of the volume of the CNS. In the human brain, the telencephalon covers most of
the diencephalon and the entire mesencephalon. Indeed, the allometric study of brain size among different
species shows a striking continuity from rats to whales, and allows us to complete the knowledge about the
evolution of the CNS obtained through cranial endocasts.
Mammals - which appear in the fossil record after the first fishes, amphibians, and reptiles - are the only
vertebrates to possess the evolutionarily recent, outermost part of the cerebral cortex (main part of the
telencephalon excluding olfactory bulb) known as the neocortex.[21] This part of the brain is, in mammals,
involved in higher thinking and further processing of all senses in the sensory cortices (processing for smell
was previously only done by its bulb while those for non-smell senses were only done by the tectum).[22]
The neocortex of monotremes (the duck-billed platypus and several species of spiny anteaters) and of
marsupials (such as kangaroos, koalas, opossums, wombats, and Tasmanian devils) lack the convolutions -
gyri and sulci - found in the neocortex of most placental mammals (eutherians).[23] Within placental
mammals, the size and complexity of the neocortex increased over time. The area of the neocortex of mice
is only about 1/100 that of monkeys, and that of monkeys is only about 1/10 that of humans.[21] In addition,
rats lack convolutions in their neocortex (possibly also because rats are small mammals), whereas cats have
a moderate degree of convolutions, and humans have quite extensive convolutions.[21] Extreme
convolution of the neocortex is found in dolphins, possibly related to their complex echolocation.
There are many CNS diseases and conditions, including infections such as encephalitis and poliomyelitis,
early-onset neurological disorders including ADHD and autism, seizure disorders such as epilepsy,
headache disorders such as migraine, late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, and essential tremor, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis
and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, genetic disorders such as Krabbe's disease and Huntington's
disease, as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and adrenoleukodystrophy. Lastly, cancers of the central
nervous system can cause severe illness and, when malignant, can have very high mortality rates.
Symptoms depend on the size, growth rate, location and malignancy of tumors and can include alterations
in motor control, hearing loss, headaches and changes in cognitive ability and autonomic functioning.

Cerebellum
The cerebellum (pl.: cerebella or cerebellums; Latin for ""little
brain"") is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates.
Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals
such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as it or even
larger.[1] In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in
motor control and cognitive functions such as attention and
language as well as emotional control such as regulating fear
and pleasure responses,[2][3][4] but its movement-related
functions are the most solidly established. The human
cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to
coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input
from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of
the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor
activity.[5] Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine
movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in
humans.[5]
Anatomically, the human cerebellum has the appearance of a
separate structure attached to the bottom of the brain, tucked
underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is
covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast
to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These
parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is
actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the
style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of
neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important
being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural
organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing
capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex
passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white
matter interior of the cerebellum.[6]
In addition to its direct role in motor control, the cerebellum is
necessary for several types of motor learning, most notably
learning to adjust to changes in sensorimotor relationships.
Several theoretical models have been developed to explain
sensorimotor calibration in terms of synaptic plasticity within
the cerebellum. These models derive from those formulated by
David Marr and James Albus, based on the observation that
each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives two dramatically different
types of input: one comprises thousands of weak inputs from
the parallel fibers of the granule cells; the other is an extremely

strong input from a single climbing fiber.[7] The basic concept
of the Marr-Albus theory is that the climbing fiber serves as a
""teaching signal"", which induces a long-lasting change in the
strength of parallel fiber inputs. Observations of long-term
depression in parallel fiber inputs have provided some support
for theories of this type, but their validity remains
controversial.[8]
At the level of gross anatomy, the cerebellum consists of a
tightly folded layer of cortex, with white matter underneath and
a fluid-filled ventricle at the base. Four deep cerebellar nuclei
are embedded in the white matter. Each part of the cortex
consists of the same small set of neuronal elements, laid out in a
highly stereotyped geometry. At an intermediate level, the
cerebellum and its auxiliary structures can be separated into
several hundred or thousand independently functioning
modules called ""microzones"" or ""microcompartments"".
The cerebellum is located in the posterior cranial fossa. The
fourth ventricle, pons and medulla are in front of the cerebellum.[9]
It is separated from the overlying cerebrum by a layer of leathery
dura mater, the tentorium cerebelli; all of its connections with other
parts of the brain travel through the pons. Anatomists classify the
cerebellum as part of the metencephalon, which also includes the
pons; the metencephalon is the upper part of the rhombencephalon
or ""hindbrain"". Like the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum is divided
into two cerebellar hemispheres; it also contains a narrow midline
zone (the vermis). A set of large folds is, by convention, used to
divide the overall structure into 10 smaller ""lobules"". Because of its large number of tiny granule cells, the
cerebellum contains more neurons than the total from the rest of the brain, but takes up only 10% of the total
brain volume.[10] The number of neurons in the cerebellum is related to the number of neurons in the
neocortex. There are about 3.6 times as many neurons in the cerebellum as in the neocortex, a ratio that is
conserved across many different mammalian species.[11]
The unusual surface appearance of the cerebellum conceals the fact that most of its volume is made up of a
very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a
folium. High-resolution MRI finds the adult human cerebellar cortex has an area of 730 square cm,[12]
packed within a volume of dimensions 6 cm x 5 cm x 10 cm.[10] Underneath the gray matter of the cortex
lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded
within the white matter--which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched,
tree-like appearance in cross-section--are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.[13]
Structure
Gross anatomy
Schematic representation of the
major anatomical subdivisions of the
cerebellum. Superior view of an
""unrolled"" cerebellum, placing the
vermis in one plane.
Connecting the cerebellum to different parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles.
These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar
peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an
output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the
cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is
connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input
to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to
the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three
separate fascicles taking their inputs to different parts of the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle
receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from
the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of
the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar
peduncle.[6]
Based on the surface appearance, three lobes can be distinguished
within the cerebellum: the anterior lobe (above the primary fissure),
the posterior lobe (below the primary fissure), and the
flocculonodular lobe (below the posterior fissure). These lobes
divide the cerebellum from rostral to caudal (in humans, top to
bottom). In terms of function, however, there is a more important
distinction along the medial-to-lateral dimension. Leaving out the
flocculonodular lobe, which has distinct connections and functions,
the cerebellum can be parsed functionally into a medial sector called
the spinocerebellum and a larger lateral sector called the
cerebrocerebellum.[13] A narrow strip of protruding tissue along the
midline is called the cerebellar vermis. (Vermis is Latin for
""worm"".)[13]
The smallest region, the flocculonodular lobe, is often called the vestibulocerebellum. It is the oldest part in
evolutionary terms (archicerebellum) and participates mainly in balance and spatial orientation; its primary
connections are with the vestibular nuclei, although it also receives visual and other sensory input. Damage
to this region causes disturbances of balance and gait.[13]
The medial zone of the anterior and posterior lobes constitutes the spinocerebellum, also known as
paleocerebellum. This sector of the cerebellum functions mainly to fine-tune body and limb movements. It
receives proprioceptive input from the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (including the spinocerebellar tract)
and from the cranial trigeminal nerve, as well as from visual and auditory systems.[14] It sends fibers to deep
cerebellar nuclei that, in turn, project to both the cerebral cortex and the brain stem, thus providing
modulation of descending motor systems.[13]
The lateral zone, which in humans is by far the largest part, constitutes the cerebrocerebellum, also known
as neocerebellum. It receives input exclusively from the cerebral cortex (especially the parietal lobe) via the
pontine nuclei (forming cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways), and sends output mainly to the ventrolateral
thalamus (in turn connected to motor areas of the premotor cortex and primary motor area of the cerebral
cortex) and to the red nucleus.[13] There is disagreement about the best way to describe the functions of the
Subdivisions
lateral cerebellum: It is thought to be involved in planning movement that is about to occur,[15] in evaluating
sensory information for action,[13] and in a number of purely cognitive functions, such as determining the
verb which best fits with a certain noun (as in ""sit"" for ""chair"").[16][17][18][19]
Two types of neuron play dominant roles in the cerebellar circuit: Purkinje cells and granule cells. Three
types of axons also play dominant roles: mossy fibers and climbing fibers (which enter the cerebellum from
outside), and parallel fibers (which are the axons of granule cells). There are two main pathways through
the cerebellar circuit, originating from mossy fibers and climbing fibers, both eventually terminating in the
deep cerebellar nuclei.[10]
Mossy fibers project directly to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers -
granule cells - parallel fibers - Purkinje cells - deep nuclei. Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and
also send collaterals directly to the deep nuclei.[10] The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry
fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and
cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.[20]
The cerebellar cortex is divided into three layers. At the bottom lies the thick granular layer, densely packed
with granule cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and unipolar
brush cells. In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells
and Bergmann glial cells. At the top lies the molecular layer, which contains the flattened dendritic trees of
Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell dendritic trees at
right angles. This outermost layer of the cerebellar cortex also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron:
stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell
dendrites.[10]

The top, outermost layer of the cerebellar cortex is the molecular layer. This layer contains the flattened
dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, and the huge array of parallel fibers, from the granular layer, that penetrate
the Purkinje cell dendritic trees at right angles. The molecular layer also contains two types of inhibitory
interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto
Purkinje cell dendrites.[10]
Purkinje cells are among the most distinctive neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be
recognized--they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyne in 1837. They are
distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: the dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely
flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense
planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles.[10] The dendrites are covered with dendritic

spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber.
Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in
the brain--estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje
cell run as high as 200,000.[10] The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje
cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar
cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect
nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar
nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several
types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA
as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their
targets.[10]
Purkinje cells form the heart of the cerebellar circuit, and their large size
and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their
response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording
techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate
even in the absence of the synaptic input. In awake, behaving animals,
mean rates averaging around 40 Hz are typical. The spike trains show a
mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a
single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10 ms; a
complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very
short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes.[22] Physiological
studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates
around 1  Hz and never at rates much higher than 10  Hz) are reliably
associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are
produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input.
Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred
milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.[23]
A specific, recognizable feature of Purkinje neurons is the expression of calbindin.[24] Calbindin staining of
rat brain after unilateral chronic sciatic nerve injury suggests that Purkinje neurons may be newly generated
in the adult brain, initiating the organization of new cerebellar lobules.[25]

Cerebellar granule cells, in contrast to Purkinje cells, are among the
smallest neurons in the brain. They are also the most numerous
neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number
average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's
neurons are cerebellar granule cells.[10] Their cell bodies are packed
into a thick layer at the bottom of the cerebellar cortex. A granule
cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an
enlargement called a dendritic claw.[10] These enlargements are
sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from
Golgi cells.[10]
The thin, unmyelinated axons of granule cells rise vertically to the
upper (molecular) layer of the cortex, where they split in two, with
each branch traveling horizontally to form a parallel fiber; the
splitting of the vertical branch into two horizontal branches gives
rise to a distinctive ""T"" shape. A human parallel fiber runs for an
average of 3 mm in each direction from the split, for a total length
of about 6  mm (about 1/10 of the total width of the cortical
layer).[10] As they run along, the parallel fibers pass through the
dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, contacting one of every 3-5 that they pass, making a total of 80-100
synaptic connections with Purkinje cell dendritic spines.[10] Granule cells use glutamate as their
neurotransmitter, and therefore exert excitatory effects on their targets.[10]
Granule cells receive all of their input from mossy fibers, but
outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the information in
the granule cell population activity state is the same as the
information in the mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more
expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely
packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving
animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The
most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by
David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of
mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving
input from only 4-5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond
if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if
more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme
would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer
distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.[26]
Mossy fibers enter the granular layer from their points of origin, many arising from the pontine nuclei,
others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, the total number of mossy fibers
has been estimated at 200 million.[10] These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the
cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of
enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within
structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell
Mossy fibers
dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses
onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells.[10] Each
mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20-30 rosettes; thus a
single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400-600 granule cells.[10]
Purkinje cells also receive input from the inferior olivary nucleus on the contralateral side of the brainstem
via climbing fibers. Although the inferior olive lies in the medulla oblongata and receives input from the
spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex, its output goes entirely to the cerebellum. A climbing fiber gives
off collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei before entering the cerebellar cortex, where it splits into about 10
terminal branches, each of which gives input to a single Purkinje cell.[10] In striking contrast to the 100,000-
plus inputs from parallel fibers, each Purkinje cell receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this
single fiber ""climbs"" the dendrites of the Purkinje cell, winding around them and making a total of up to
300 synapses as it goes.[10] The net input is so strong that a single action potential from a climbing fiber is
capable of producing an extended complex spike in the Purkinje cell: a burst of several spikes in a row, with
diminishing amplitude, followed by a pause during which activity is suppressed. The climbing fiber
synapses cover the cell body and proximal dendrites; this zone is devoid of parallel fiber inputs.[10]
Climbing fibers fire at low rates, but a single climbing fiber action potential induces a burst of several action
potentials in a target Purkinje cell (a complex spike). The contrast between parallel fiber and climbing fiber
inputs to Purkinje cells (over 100,000 of one type versus exactly one of the other type) is perhaps the most
provocative feature of cerebellar anatomy, and has motivated much of the theorizing. In fact, the function of
climbing fibers is the most controversial topic concerning the cerebellum. There are two schools of thought,
one following Marr and Albus in holding that climbing fiber input serves primarily as a teaching signal, the
other holding that its function is to shape cerebellar output directly. Both views have been defended in great
length in numerous publications. In the words of one review, ""In trying to synthesize the various hypotheses
on the function of the climbing fibers, one has the sense of looking at a drawing by Escher. Each point of
view seems to account for a certain collection of findings, but when one attempts to put the different views
together, a coherent picture of what the climbing fibers are doing does not appear. For the majority of
researchers, the climbing fibers signal errors in motor performance, either in the usual manner of discharge
frequency modulation or as a single announcement of an 'unexpected event'. For other investigators, the
message lies in the degree of ensemble synchrony and rhythmicity among a population of climbing
fibers.""[23]
The deep nuclei of the cerebellum are clusters of gray matter lying within the white matter at the core of the
cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output
from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as
well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose,
emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The
globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial
and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much
larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively

and microzones in the cerebellar cortex
with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The
flocculus of the flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the
cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei--
its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.[10]
The majority of neurons in the deep nuclei have large cell
bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about
400  mm, and use glutamate as their neurotransmitter.
These cells project to a variety of targets outside the
cerebellum. Intermixed with them are a lesser number of
small cells, which use GABA as a neurotransmitter and
project exclusively to the inferior olivary nucleus, the
source of climbing fibers. Thus, the nucleo-olivary
projection provides an inhibitory feedback to match the
excitatory projection of climbing fibers to the nuclei.
There is evidence that each small cluster of nuclear cells
projects to the same cluster of olivary cells that send climbing fibers to it; there is strong and matching
topography in both directions.[10]
When a Purkinje cell axon enters one of the deep nuclei, it branches to make contact with both large and
small nuclear cells, but the total number of cells contacted is only about 35 (in cats). Conversely, a single
deep nuclear cell receives input from approximately 860 Purkinje cells (again in cats).[10]
From the viewpoint of gross anatomy, the cerebellar
cortex appears to be a homogeneous sheet of tissue, and,
from the viewpoint of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet
appear to have the same internal structure. There are,
however, a number of respects in which the structure of
the cerebellum is compartmentalized. There are large
compartments that are generally known as zones; these
can be divided into smaller compartments known as
microzones.[27]
The first indications of compartmental structure came from
studies of the receptive fields of cells in various parts of
the cerebellar cortex.[27] Each body part maps to specific
points in the cerebellum, but there are numerous repetitions of the basic map, forming an arrangement that
has been called ""fractured somatotopy"".[28] A clearer indication of compartmentalization is obtained by
immunostaining the cerebellum for certain types of protein. The best-known of these markers are called
""zebrins"", because staining for them gives rise to a complex pattern reminiscent of the stripes on a zebra.
The stripes generated by zebrins and other compartmentalization markers are oriented perpendicular to the
cerebellar folds--that is, they are narrow in the mediolateral direction, but much more extended in the
longitudinal direction. Different markers generate different sets of stripes, the widths and lengths vary as a
function of location, but they all have the same general shape.[27]
Compartments
Oscarsson in the late 1970s proposed that these cortical zones can be partitioned into smaller units called
microzones.[29] A microzone is defined as a group of Purkinje cells all having the same somatotopic
receptive field. Microzones were found to contain on the order of 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a
long, narrow strip, oriented perpendicular to the cortical folds.[27] Thus, as the adjoining diagram illustrates,
Purkinje cell dendrites are flattened in the same direction as the microzones extend, while parallel fibers
cross them at right angles.[10]
It is not only receptive fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber input from the inferior
olivary nucleus is equally important. The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually
activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing
fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing
Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale.[27]
Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons to the same small cluster of output
cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei.[27] Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the
longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single
microzone.[27] The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are
much stronger than interactions between different microzones.[27]
In 2005, Richard Apps and Martin Garwicz summarized evidence that microzones themselves form part of
a larger entity they call a multizonal microcomplex. Such a microcomplex includes several spatially
separated cortical microzones, all of which project to the same group of deep cerebellar neurons, plus a
group of coupled olivary neurons that project to all of the included microzones as well as to the deep
nuclear area.[27]
The cerebellum is provided with blood from three paired major arteries: the superior cerebellar artery
(SCA), the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA).
The SCA supplies the upper region of the cerebellum. It divides at the upper surface and branches into the
pia mater where the branches anastomose with those of the anterior and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries.
The AICA supplies the front part of the undersurface of the cerebellum. The PICA arrives at the
undersurface, where it divides into a medial branch and a lateral branch. The medial branch continues
backward to the cerebellar notch between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum; while the lateral branch
supplies the under surface of the cerebellum, as far as its lateral border, where it anastomoses with the AICA
and the SCA.
The strongest clues to the function of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of
damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor
control, on the same side of the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to
generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed
movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's
length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with
cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-
Blood supply
Function
motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the
basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or
to decide which movements to execute.[13]
Prior to the 1990s the function of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related,
but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar
activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions
between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms
have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum.[30][31] In
particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome[32] has been described in
adults[33] and children.[34] Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI
suggest that more than half of the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral
cortex.[35]
Kenji Doya has argued that the cerebellum's function is best understood not in terms of the behaviors it
affects, but the neural computations it performs; the cerebellum consists of a large number of more or less
independent modules, all with the same geometrically regular internal structure, and therefore all, it is
presumed, performing the same computation. If the input and output connections of a module are with
motor areas (as many are), then the module will be involved in motor behavior; but, if the connections are
with areas involved in non-motor cognition, the module will show other types of behavioral correlates.
Thus the cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of many differing functional traits such as
affection, emotion including emotional body language perception[36] and behavior.[37][38] The cerebellum,
Doya proposes, is best understood as predictive action selection based on ""internal models"" of the
environment or a device for supervised learning, in contrast to the basal ganglia, which perform
reinforcement learning, and the cerebral cortex, which performs unsupervised learning.[31][39] Three
decades of brain research have led to the proposal that the cerebellum generates optimized mental models
and interacts closely with the cerebral cortex, where updated internal models are experienced as creative
intuition (""a ha"") in working memory. [40]
The comparative simplicity and regularity of the cerebellar anatomy led to an early hope that it might imply
a similar simplicity of computational function, as expressed in one of the first books on cerebellar
electrophysiology, The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine by John C. Eccles, Masao Ito, and Janos
Szentagothai.[41] Although a full understanding of cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four
principles have been identified as important: (1) feedforward processing, (2) divergence and convergence,
(3) modularity, and (4) plasticity.
1. Feedforward processing: The cerebellum differs from most other parts of the brain
(especially the cerebral cortex) in that the signal processing is almost entirely feedforward--
that is, signals move unidirectionally through the system from input to output, with very little
recurrent internal transmission. The small amount of recurrence that does exist consists of
mutual inhibition; there are no mutually excitatory circuits. This feedforward mode of
operation means that the cerebellum, in contrast to the cerebral cortex, cannot generate self-
sustaining patterns of neural activity. Signals enter the circuit, are processed by each stage
in sequential order, and then leave. As Eccles, Ito, and Szentagothai wrote, ""This elimination
in the design of all possibility of reverberatory chains of neuronal excitation is undoubtedly a
great advantage in the performance of the cerebellum as a computer, because what the rest
of the nervous system requires from the cerebellum is presumably not some output
Principles
expressing the operation of complex reverberatory circuits in the cerebellum but rather a
quick and clear response to the input of any particular set of information.""[42]
2. Divergence and convergence: In the human cerebellum, information from 200 million
mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then
converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells.[10] Because of the way that they are lined up
longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from
as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down to a group of less
than 50 deep nuclear cells.[27] Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of
inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network,
and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.
3. Modularity: The cerebellar system is functionally divided into more or less independent
modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules have a similar
internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment
in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior
olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex
(microzones), and a small cluster of neurons in one of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Different
modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear
to function independently--the output of one module does not appear to significantly
influence the activity of other modules.[27]
4. Plasticity: The synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells, and the synapses
between mossy fibers and deep nuclear cells, are both susceptible to modification of their
strength. In a single cerebellar module, input from as many as a billion parallel fibers
converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, and the influence of each parallel
fiber on those nuclear cells is adjustable. This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for
fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar inputs and outputs.[43]
There is considerable evidence that the cerebellum plays an essential role in some types of motor learning.
The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine
adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether
learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote
learning in other brain structures.[43] Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are
derived from the ideas of David Marr[26] and James Albus,[7] who postulated that climbing fibers provide a
teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses.[44] Marr assumed
that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most
subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber
activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be
weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita[45] made attempts to
understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.
The idea that climbing fiber activity functions as an error signal has been examined in many experimental
studies, with some supporting it but others casting doubt.[23] In a pioneering study by Gilbert and Thach
from 1977, Purkinje cells from monkeys learning a reaching task showed increased complex spike activity
--which is known to reliably indicate activity of the cell's climbing fiber input--during periods when
performance was poor.[46] Several studies of motor learning in cats observed complex spike activity when
there was a mismatch between an intended movement and the movement that was actually executed.
Studies of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (which stabilizes the visual image on the retina when the head turns)
found that climbing fiber activity indicated ""retinal slip"", although not in a very straightforward way.[23]
Learning
Model of a cerebellar perceptron, as
formulated by James Albus
One of the most extensively studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in
which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an
unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated
presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response
or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of
the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a
conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the
inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response,
whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place--these facts taken together make a
strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.[47]
The large base of knowledge about the anatomical structure and
behavioral functions of the cerebellum have made it a fertile ground
for theorizing--there are perhaps more theories of the function of
the cerebellum than of any other part of the brain. The most basic
distinction among them is between ""learning theories"" and
""performance theories""--that is, theories that make use of synaptic
plasticity within the cerebellum to account for its role in learning,
versus theories that account for aspects of ongoing behavior on the
basis of cerebellar signal processing. Several theories of both types
have been formulated as mathematical models and simulated using
computers.[44]
Perhaps the earliest ""performance"" theory was the ""delay line""
hypothesis of Valentino Braitenberg. The original theory put forth by Braitenberg and Roger Atwood in
1958 proposed that slow propagation of signals along parallel fibers imposes predictable delays that allow
the cerebellum to detect time relationships within a certain window.[48] Experimental data did not support
the original form of the theory, but Braitenberg continued to argue for modified versions.[49] The hypothesis
that the cerebellum functions essentially as a timing system has also been advocated by Richard Ivry.[50]
Another influential ""performance"" theory is the Tensor network theory of Pellionisz and Llinas, which
provided an advanced mathematical formulation of the idea that the fundamental computation performed by
the cerebellum is to transform sensory into motor coordinates.[51]
Theories in the ""learning"" category almost all derive from publications by Marr and Albus. Marr's 1969
paper proposed that the cerebellum is a device for learning to associate elemental movements encoded by
climbing fibers with mossy fiber inputs that encode the sensory context.[26] Albus proposed in 1971 that a
cerebellar Purkinje cell functions as a perceptron, a neurally inspired abstract learning device.[7] The most
basic difference between the Marr and Albus theories is that Marr assumed that climbing fiber activity
would cause parallel fiber synapses to be strengthened, whereas Albus proposed that they would be
weakened. Albus also formulated his version as a software algorithm he called a CMAC (Cerebellar Model
Articulation Controller), which has been tested in a number of applications.[52]

Damage to the cerebellum often causes motor-related symptoms,
the details of which depend on the part of the cerebellum involved
and how it is damaged. Damage to the flocculonodular lobe may
show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered,
irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in
balancing.[13] Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems
in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause
errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements.
Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone),
dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems
judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia
(inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking),
impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention
tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions
of opposing muscle groups).[53][54] Damage to the midline portion
may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized
more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands
or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause
gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage
to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly
aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in
speed.[13] This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.
To identify cerebellar problems, neurological examination includes
assessment of gait (a broad-based gait being indicative of ataxia),
finger-pointing tests and assessment of posture.[5] If cerebellar dysfunction is indicated, a magnetic
resonance imaging scan can be used to obtain a detailed picture of any structural alterations that may
exist.[55]
The list of medical problems that can produce cerebellar damage is long, including stroke, hemorrhage,
swelling of the brain (cerebral edema), tumors, alcoholism, physical trauma such as gunshot wounds or
explosives, and chronic degenerative conditions such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy.[56][57] Some forms
of migraine headache may also produce temporary dysfunction of the cerebellum, of variable severity.[58]
Infection can result in cerebellar damage in such conditions as the prion diseases[59] and Miller Fisher
syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
The human cerebellum changes with age. These changes may differ from those of other parts of the brain.
The cerebellum is the youngest brain region (and body part) in centenarians according to an epigenetic
biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a
centenarian.[60] Further, gene expression patterns in the human cerebellum show less age-related alteration
than that in the cerebral cortex.[61] Some studies have reported reductions in numbers of cells or volume of
tissue, but the amount of data relating to this question is not very large.[62][63]

Developmental and degenerative disorders

Congenital malformation, hereditary disorders, and acquired
conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently,
cerebellar function. Unless the causative condition is reversible, the
only possible treatment is to help people live with their
problems.[64] Visualization of the fetal cerebellum by ultrasound
scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy can be used to screen for fetal
neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.[65]
In normal development, endogenous sonic hedgehog signaling
stimulates rapid proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron
progenitors (CGNPs) in the external granule layer (EGL).
Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the
early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking
during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse).[66] As
CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellar granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs),
they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the
mouse).[66] Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the
cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse
models.[67][68]
Congenital malformation or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is a characteristic of
both Dandy-Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome.[69][70] In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may
be absent.[71] The inherited neurological disorders Machado-Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and
Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss.[56][64] Congenital brain
malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some
forms of Arnold-Chiari malformation.[72]
Other conditions that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive
neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I,[73][74] and the
autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit
an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum.[75] Cerebellar atrophy can result from
an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome,[76]
or vitamin E deficiency.[64]
Cerebellar atrophy has been observed in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease,
multiple sclerosis,[59] essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemann-Pick disease.
Cerebellar atrophy can also occur as a result of exposure to toxins including heavy metals or pharmaceutical
or recreational drugs.[64]
There is a general consensus that the cerebellum is involved in pain processing.[77][78] The cerebellum
receives pain input from both descending cortico-cerebellar pathways and ascending spino-cerebellar
pathways, through the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Some of this information is transferred to the
motor system inducing a conscious motor avoidance of pain, graded according to pain intensity.
Pain

These direct pain inputs, as well as indirect inputs, are thought to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior
that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of
vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic
anatomical remodeling of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum.[25] The magnitude of this remodeling
and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these
changes.
The circuits in the cerebellum are similar across all classes of
vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.[79]
There is also an analogous brain structure in cephalopods with
well-developed brains, such as octopuses.[80] This has been
taken as evidence that the cerebellum performs functions
important to all animal species with a brain.
There is considerable variation in the size and shape of the
cerebellum in different vertebrate species. In amphibians, it is
little developed, and in lampreys, and hagfish, the cerebellum is barely distinguishable from the brain-stem.
Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small, paired-nuclei
corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum.[81] The cerebellum is a bit larger in reptiles, considerably larger
in birds, and larger still in mammals. The large paired and convoluted lobes found in humans are typical of
mammals, but the cerebellum is, in general, a single median lobe in other groups, and is either smooth or
only slightly grooved. In mammals, the neocerebellum is the major part of the cerebellum by mass, but, in
other vertebrates, it is typically the spinocerebellum.[81]
The cerebellum of cartilaginous and bony fishes is extraordinarily large and complex. In at least one
important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish cerebellum does
not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei. Instead, the primary targets of Purkinje cells are a distinct type of
cell distributed across the cerebellar cortex, a type not seen in mammals. In mormyrid fish (a family of
weakly electrosensitive freshwater fish), the cerebellum is considerably larger than the rest of the brain. The
largest part of it is a special structure called the valvula, which has an unusually regular architecture and
receives much of its input from the electrosensory system.[82]
The hallmark of the mammalian cerebellum is an expansion of the lateral lobes, whose main interactions are
with the neocortex. As monkeys evolved into great apes, the expansion of the lateral lobes continued, in
tandem with the expansion of the frontal lobes of the neocortex. In ancestral hominids, and in Homo
sapiens until the middle Pleistocene period, the cerebellum continued to expand, but the frontal lobes
expanded more rapidly. The most recent period of human evolution, however, may actually have been
associated with an increase in the relative size of the cerebellum, as the neocortex reduced its size somewhat
while the cerebellum expanded.[83] The size of the human cerebellum, compared to the rest of the brain, has
been increasing in size while the cerebrum decreased in size [84] With both the development and
implementation of motor tasks, visual-spatial skills and learning taking place in the cerebellum, the growth
of the cerebellum is thought to have some form of correlation to greater human cognitive abilities.[85] The
lateral hemispheres of the cerebellum are now 2.7 times greater in both humans and apes than they are in
monkeys.[84] These changes in the cerebellum size cannot be explained by greater muscle mass. They show
that either the development of the cerebellum is tightly linked to that of the rest of the brain or that neural
Comparative anatomy and evolution
activities taking place in the cerebellum were important during Hominidae evolution. Due to the
cerebellum's role in cognitive functions, the increase in its size may have played a role in cognitive
expansion.[84]
Most vertebrate species have a cerebellum and one or more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that
resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry.[79] The only cerebellum-like
structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), one of the two primary sensory nuclei
that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer
containing granule cells similar to those of the cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the
superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons
called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically--they receive parallel fiber
input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are
pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects--they have spiny,
flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that
receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the
parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably
reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial
hearing in one way or another.[86]
Most species of fish and amphibians possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water. One
of the brain areas that receives primary input from the lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus,
has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the input from
the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like
structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer--the marginal layer--
that is cerebellum-like.[79]
All of these cerebellum-like structures appear to be primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All
of them have granule cells that give rise to parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with
modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum--instead they
receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most
influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to
compensate for changes in body posture.[79] In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly on the
basis of these structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is
fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that
controls the resulting sensory signals.[87] Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the
cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.[88][89]
Even the earliest anatomists were able to recognize the cerebellum by its distinctive appearance. Aristotle
and Herophilus (quoted in Galen) called it the paregkephalis (parenkephalis), as opposed to the egkephalos
(enkephalos) or brain proper. Galen's extensive description is the earliest that survives. He speculated that
the cerebellum was the source of motor nerves.[90]

Further significant developments did not come until the
Renaissance. Vesalius discussed the cerebellum briefly, and the
anatomy was described more thoroughly by Thomas Willis in 1664.
More anatomical work was done during the 18th century, but it was
not until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the
function of the cerebellum were obtained. Luigi Rolando in 1809
established the key finding that damage to the cerebellum results in
motor disturbances. Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th
century carried out detailed experimental work, which revealed that
animals with cerebellar damage can still move, but with a loss of
coordination (strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular
weakness), and that recovery after the lesion can be nearly complete
unless the lesion is very extensive.[91] By the beginning of the 20th
century, it was widely accepted that the primary function of the
cerebellum relates to motor control; the first half of the 20th century
produced several detailed descriptions of the clinical symptoms
associated with cerebellar disease in humans.[5]
The name cerebellum is a diminutive of cerebrum (brain);[92] it can be translated literally as little brain. The
Latin name is a direct translation of the Ancient Greek paregkephalis (parenkephalis), which was used in
the works of Aristotle, the first known writer to describe the structure.[93] No other name is used in the
English-language literature, but historically a variety of Greek or Latin-derived names have been used,
including 
cerebrum 
parvum,[94] 
encephalion,[95] 
encranion,[94] 
cerebrum 
posterius,[96] 
and
parencephalis.[94]

Cerebral cortex
The cerebral cortex, also known as the cerebral mantle,[1] is
the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain in
humans and other mammals. It is the largest site of neural
integration in the central nervous system,[2] and plays a key role
in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language,
and consciousness. The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain
responsible for cognition.
The six-layered neocortex makes up approximately 90% of the
cortex, with the allocortex making up the remainder.[3] The
cortex is divided into left and right parts by the longitudinal
fissure, which separates the two cerebral hemispheres that are
joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum. In most
mammals, apart from small mammals that have small brains, the
cerebral cortex is folded, providing a greater surface area in the
confined volume of the cranium. Apart from minimising brain
and cranial volume, cortical folding is crucial for the brain
circuitry and its functional organisation.[4] In mammals with
small brains, there is no folding and the cortex is smooth.[5][6]
A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and
a groove is termed a sulcus (plural sulci). These surface
convolutions appear during fetal development and continue to
mature after birth through the process of gyrification. In the
human brain, the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible
from the outside, but buried in the sulci.[7] The major sulci and
gyri mark the divisions of the cerebrum into the lobes of the
brain. The four major lobes are the frontal, parietal, occipital
and temporal lobes. Other lobes are the limbic lobe, and the
insular cortex often referred to as the insular lobe.
There are between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the human
cerebral cortex.[2] These are organised into horizontal cortical
layers, and radially into cortical columns and minicolumns.
Cortical areas have specific functions such as movement in the
motor cortex, and sight in the visual cortex. The motor cortex is
primarily located in the precentral gyrus, and the visual cortex is
located in the occipital lobe.

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Lateral view of cerebrum showing
several cortices
The cerebral cortex is the outer covering of the surfaces of the
cerebral hemispheres and is folded into peaks called gyri, and
grooves called sulci. In the human brain, it is between 2 and 3-4
mm. thick,[8] and makes up 40% of the brain's mass.[2] 90% of
the cerebral cortex is the six-layered neocortex whilst the other
10% made up of three/four-layered allocortex.[2] There are
between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the cortex,[2] and these
are organized radially in cortical columns, and minicolumns, in
the horizontally organized layers of the cortex.[9][10]
The neocortex is separable into different regions of cortex
known in the plural as cortices, and include the motor cortex
and visual cortex. About two thirds of the cortical surface is
buried in the sulci and the insular cortex is completely hidden.
The cortex is thickest over the top of a gyrus and thinnest at the
bottom of a sulcus.[11]
The cerebral cortex is folded in a way that allows a large
surface area of neural tissue to fit within the confines of the
neurocranium. When unfolded in the human, each hemispheric
cortex has a total surface area of about 0.12 square metres
(1.3 sq ft).[12] The folding is inward away from the surface of the
brain, and is also present on the medial surface of each hemisphere
within the longitudinal fissure. Most mammals have a cerebral
cortex that is convoluted with the peaks known as gyri and the
troughs or grooves known as sulci. Some small mammals including
some small rodents have smooth cerebral surfaces without
gyrification.[6]
The larger sulci and gyri mark the divisions of the cortex of the
cerebrum into the lobes of the brain.[8] There are four main lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal
lobe, and occipital lobe. The insular cortex is often included as the insular lobe.[13] The limbic lobe is a rim
of cortex on the medial side of each hemisphere and is also often included.[14] There are also three lobules
of the brain described: the paracentral lobule, the superior parietal lobule, and the inferior parietal lobule.
For species of mammals, larger brains (in absolute terms, not just in relation to body size) tend to have
thicker cortices.[15] The smallest mammals, such as shrews, have a neocortical thickness of about 0.5 mm;
the ones with the largest brains, such as humans and fin whales, have thicknesses of 2-4 mm.[2][8] There is
an approximately logarithmic relationship between brain weight and cortical thickness.[15] Magnetic
resonance imaging of the brain (MRI) makes it possible to get a measure for the thickness of the human
cerebral cortex and relate it to other measures. The thickness of different cortical areas varies but in general,

sensory cortex is thinner than motor cortex.[16] One study has found some positive association between the
cortical thickness and intelligence.[17] Another study has found that the somatosensory cortex is thicker in
migraine patients, though it is not known if this is the result of migraine attacks, the cause of them or if both
are the result of a shared cause.[18][19] A later study using a larger patient population reports no change in
the cortical thickness in patients with migraine.[20] A genetic disorder of the cerebral cortex, whereby
decreased folding in certain areas results in a microgyrus, where there are four layers instead of six, is in
some instances seen to be related to dyslexia.[21]
The neocortex is formed of six layers, numbered I to VI, from the
outermost layer I - near to the pia mater, to the innermost layer VI -
near to the underlying white matter. Each cortical layer has a
characteristic distribution of different neurons and their connections
with other cortical and subcortical regions. There are direct
connections between different cortical areas and indirect
connections via the thalamus.
One of the clearest examples of cortical layering is the line of
Gennari in the primary visual cortex. This is a band of whiter tissue
that can be observed with the naked eye in the calcarine sulcus of
the occipital lobe. The line of Gennari is composed of axons
bringing visual information from the thalamus into layer IV of the
visual cortex.
Staining cross-sections of the cortex to reveal the position of
neuronal cell bodies and the intracortical axon tracts allowed
neuroanatomists in the early 20th century to produce a detailed
description of the laminar structure of the cortex in different
species. The work of Korbinian Brodmann (1909) established that
the mammalian neocortex is consistently divided into six layers.
Layer I is the molecular layer of cerebral cortex|molecular layer, and contains few scattered neurons,
including GABAergic rosehip neurons.[22] Layer I consists largely of extensions of apical dendritic tufts of
pyramidal neurons and horizontally oriented axons, as well as glial cells.[4] During development, Cajal-
Retzius cells[23] and subpial granular layer cells[24] are present in this layer. Also, some spiny stellate cells
can be found here. Inputs to the apical tufts are thought to be crucial for the feedback interactions in the
cerebral cortex involved in associative learning and attention.[25] While it was once thought that the input to
layer I came from the cortex itself,[26] it is now realized that layer I across the cerebral cortex mantle
receives substantial input from matrix or M-type thalamus cells[27] (in contrast to core or C-type that go to
layer IV).[28]

11/2 month-old infant. The Nissl stain
shows the cell bodies of neurons; the
Golgi stain shows the dendrites and
axons of a random subset of
neurons.
Layer II, the external granular layer, contains small pyramidal
neurons and numerous stellate neurons.
Layer III, the external pyramidal layer, contains predominantly
small and medium-size pyramidal neurons, as well as non-
pyramidal neurons with vertically oriented intracortical axons;
layers I through III are the main target of interhemispheric
corticocortical afferents, and layer III is the principal source of
corticocortical efferents.
Layer IV, the internal granular layer, contains different types of
stellate and pyramidal cells, and is the main target of thalamocortical
afferents from thalamus type C neurons (core-type)[28] as well as
intra-hemispheric corticocortical afferents. The layers above layer
IV are also referred to as supragranular layers (layers I-III), whereas
the layers below are referred to as infragranular layers (layers V and
VI).
Layer V, the internal pyramidal layer, contains large pyramidal
neurons. Axons from these leave the cortex and connect with
subcortical structures including the basal ganglia. In the primary
motor cortex of the frontal lobe, layer V contains giant pyramidal cells called Betz cells, whose axons travel
through the internal capsule, the brain stem, and the spinal cord forming the corticospinal tract, which is the
main pathway for voluntary motor control.
Layer VI, the polymorphic layer or multiform layer, contains few large pyramidal neurons and many
small spindle-like pyramidal and multiform neurons; layer VI sends efferent fibers to the thalamus,
establishing a very precise reciprocal interconnection between the cortex and the thalamus.[29] That is, layer
VI neurons from one cortical column connect with thalamus neurons that provide input to the same cortical
column. These connections are both excitatory and inhibitory. Neurons send excitatory fibers to neurons in
the thalamus and also send collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus that inhibit these same thalamus
neurons or ones adjacent to them.[30] One theory is that because the inhibitory output is reduced by
cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex, this provides the brainstem with adjustable ""gain control for the
relay of lemniscal inputs"".[30]
The cortical layers are not simply stacked one over the other; there exist characteristic connections between
different layers and neuronal types, which span all the thickness of the cortex. These cortical microcircuits
are grouped into cortical columns and minicolumns.[31] It has been proposed that the minicolumns are the

basic functional units of the cortex.[32] In 1957, Vernon
Mountcastle showed that the functional properties of the cortex
change abruptly between laterally adjacent points; however, they
are continuous in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Later
works have provided evidence of the presence of functionally
distinct cortical columns in the visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel,
1959),[33] auditory cortex, and associative cortex.
Cortical areas that lack a layer IV are called agranular. Cortical
areas that have only a rudimentary layer IV are called
dysgranular.[34] Information processing within each layer is
determined by different temporal dynamics with that in layers II/III
having a slow 2 Hz oscillation while that in layer V has a fast 10-
15 Hz oscillation.[35]
Based on the differences in laminar organization the cerebral cortex
can be classified into two types, the large area of neocortex which
has six cell layers, and the much smaller area of allocortex that has
three or four layers:[3]
The neocortex is also known as the isocortex or
neopallium and is the part of the mature cerebral cortex
with six distinct layers. Examples of neocortical areas
include the granular primary motor cortex, and the striate
primary visual cortex. The neocortex has two subtypes,
the true isocortex and the proisocortex which is a
transitional region between the isocortex and the regions
of the periallocortex.
The allocortex is the part of the cerebral cortex with three
or four layers, and has three subtypes, the paleocortex
with three cortical laminae, the archicortex which has
four or five, and a transitional area adjacent to the
allocortex, the periallocortex. Examples of allocortex are
the olfactory cortex and the hippocampus.
There is a transitional area between the neocortex and the allocortex called the paralimbic cortex, where
layers 2, 3 and 4 are merged. This area incorporates the proisocortex of the neocortex and the periallocortex
of the allocortex. In addition, the cerebral cortex may be classified into four lobes: the frontal lobe, temporal
lobe, the parietal lobe, and the occipital lobe, named from their overlying bones of the skull.
Blood supply to the cerebral cortex is part of the cerebral circulation. Cerebral arteries supply the blood that
perfuses the cerebrum. This arterial blood carries oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients to the cortex.
Cerebral veins drain the deoxygenated blood, and metabolic wastes including carbon dioxide, back to the
heart.

Cortical blood supply
The main arteries supplying the cortex are the anterior cerebral
artery, the middle cerebral artery, and the posterior cerebral artery.
The anterior cerebral artery supplies the anterior portions of the
brain, including most of the frontal lobe. The middle cerebral artery
supplies the parietal lobes, temporal lobes, and parts of the occipital
lobes. The middle cerebral artery splits into two branches to supply
the left and right hemisphere, where they branch further. The
posterior cerebral artery supplies the occipital lobes.
The circle of Willis is the main blood system that deals with blood
supply in the cerebrum and cerebral cortex.
The prenatal development of the cerebral cortex is a complex and finely tuned process called corticogenesis,
influenced by the interplay between genes and the environment.[36]
The cerebral cortex develops from the most anterior part, the forebrain region, of the neural tube.[37][38]
The neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube. From the cavity inside the neural tube develops
the ventricular system, and, from the neuroepithelial cells of its walls, the neurons and glia of the nervous
system. The most anterior (front, or cranial) part of the neural plate, the prosencephalon, which is evident
before neurulation begins, gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres and later cortex.[39]
Cortical neurons are generated within the ventricular zone, next to the ventricles. At first, this zone contains
neural stem cells, that transition to radial glial cells-progenitor cells, which divide to produce glial cells and
neurons.[40]

Neurogenesis is shown in red and
lamination is shown in blue. Adapted

The cerebral cortex is composed of a heterogenous population of
cells that give rise to different cell types. The majority of these cells
are derived from radial glia migration that form the different cell
types of the neocortex and it is a period associated with an increase
in neurogenesis. Similarly, the process of neurogenesis regulates
lamination to form the different layers of the cortex. During this
process there is an increase in the restriction of cell fate that begins
with earlier progenitors giving rise to any cell type in the cortex and
later progenitors giving rise only to neurons of superficial layers.
This differential cell fate creates an inside-out topography in the
cortex with younger neurons in superficial layers and older neurons
in deeper layers. In addition, laminar neurons are stopped in S or G2 phase in order to give a fine distinction
between the different cortical layers. Laminar differentiation is not fully complete until after birth since
during development laminar neurons are still sensitive to extrinsic signals and environmental cues.[41]
Although the majority of the cells that compose the cortex are derived locally from radial glia there is a
subset population of neurons that migrate from other regions. Radial glia give rise to neurons that are
pyramidal in shape and use glutamate as a neurotransmitter, however these migrating cells contribute
neurons that are stellate-shaped and use GABA as their main neurotransmitter. These GABAergic neurons
are generated by progenitor cells in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) that migrate tangentially to the
cortex via the subventricular zone. This migration of GABAergic neurons is particularly important since
GABA receptors are excitatory during development. This excitation is primarily driven by the flux of
chloride ions through the GABA receptor, however in adults chloride concentrations shift causing an
inward flux of chloride that hyperpolarizes postsynaptic neurons.[42] The glial fibers produced in the first
divisions of the progenitor cells are radially oriented, spanning the thickness of the cortex from the
ventricular zone to the outer, pial surface, and provide scaffolding for the migration of neurons outwards
from the ventricular zone.[43][44]
At birth there are very few dendrites present on the cortical neuron's cell body, and the axon is
undeveloped. During the first year of life the dendrites become dramatically increased in number, such that
they can accommodate up to a hundred thousand synaptic connections with other neurons. The axon can
develop to extend a long way from the cell body.[45]
The first divisions of the progenitor cells are symmetric, which duplicates the total number of progenitor
cells at each mitotic cycle. Then, some progenitor cells begin to divide asymmetrically, producing one
postmitotic cell that migrates along the radial glial fibers, leaving the ventricular zone, and one progenitor
cell, which continues to divide until the end of development, when it differentiates into a glial cell or an
ependymal cell. As the G1 phase of mitosis is elongated, in what is seen as selective cell-cycle lengthening,
the newly born neurons migrate to more superficial layers of the cortex.[46] The migrating daughter cells
become the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex.[47] The development process is time ordered and
regulated by hundreds of genes and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.[48]

The layered structure of the mature cerebral cortex is formed during
development. The first pyramidal neurons generated migrate out of
the ventricular zone and subventricular zone, together with reelin-
producing Cajal-Retzius neurons, from the preplate. Next, a
cohort of neurons migrating into the middle of the preplate divides
this transient layer into the superficial marginal zone, which will
become layer I of the mature neocortex, and the subplate,[49]
forming a middle layer called the cortical plate. These cells will
form the deep layers of the mature cortex, layers five and six. Later
born neurons migrate radially into the cortical plate past the deep
layer neurons, and become the upper layers (two to four). Thus, the
layers of the cortex are created in an inside-out order.[50] The only
exception to this inside-out sequence of neurogenesis occurs in the
layer I of primates, in which, in contrast to rodents, neurogenesis
continues throughout the entire period of corticogenesis.[51]
The map of functional cortical areas, which include primary motor
and visual cortex, originates from a 'protomap',[52] which is
regulated by molecular signals such as fibroblast growth factor
FGF8 early in embryonic development.[53][54] These signals
regulate the size, shape, and position of cortical areas on the surface
of the cortical primordium, in part by regulating gradients of
transcription factor expression, through a process called cortical
patterning. Examples of such transcription factors include the genes
EMX2 and PAX6.[55] Together, both transcription factors form an
opposing gradient of expression. Pax6 is highly expressed at the
rostral lateral pole, while Emx2 is highly expressed in the
caudomedial pole. The establishment of this gradient is important
for proper development. For example, mutations in Pax6 can cause
expression levels of Emx2 to expand out of its normal expression
domain, which would ultimately lead to an expansion of the areas
normally derived from the caudal medial cortex, such as the visual
cortex. On the contrary, if mutations in Emx2 occur, it can cause the
Pax6-expressing domain to expand and result in the frontal and
motor cortical regions enlarging. Therefore, researchers believe that similar gradients and signaling centers
next to the cortex could contribute to the regional expression of these transcription factors.[42] Two very
well studied patterning signals for the cortex include FGF and retinoic acid. If FGFs are misexpressed in
different areas of the developing cortex, cortical patterning is disrupted. Specifically, when Fgf8 is increased
in the anterior pole, Emx2 is downregulated and a caudal shift in the cortical region occurs. This ultimately
causes an expansion of the rostral regions. Therefore, Fgf8 and other FGFs play a role in the regulation of
expression of Emx2 and Pax6 and represent how the cerebral cortex can become specialized for different
functions.[42]
Cortical patterning
Some functional areas of cortex
Rapid expansion of the cortical surface area is regulated by the amount of self-renewal of radial glial cells
and is partly regulated by FGF and Notch genes.[56] During the period of cortical neurogenesis and layer
formation, many higher mammals begin the process of gyrification, which generates the characteristic folds
of the cerebral cortex.[57][58] Gyrification is regulated by a DNA-associated protein Trnp1[59] and by FGF
and SHH signaling[60][61]
Of all the different brain regions, the cerebral cortex shows the largest evolutionary variation and has
evolved most recently.[6] In contrast to the highly conserved circuitry of the medulla oblongata, for
example, which serves critical functions such as regulation of heart and respiration rates, many areas of the
cerebral cortex are not strictly necessary for survival. Thus, the evolution of the cerebral cortex has seen the
advent and modification of new functional areas--particularly association areas that do not directly receive
input from outside the cortex.[6]
A key theory of cortical evolution is embodied in the radial unit hypothesis and related protomap
hypothesis, first proposed by Rakic.[62] This theory states that new cortical areas are formed by the addition
of new radial units, which is accomplished at the stem cell level. The protomap hypothesis states that the
cellular and molecular identity and characteristics of neurons in each cortical area are specified by cortical
stem cells, known as radial glial cells, in a primordial map. This map is controlled by secreted signaling
proteins and downstream transcription factors.[63][64][65]
The cerebral cortex is connected to various subcortical structures
such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia, sending information to
them along efferent connections and receiving information from
them via afferent connections. Most sensory information is routed to
the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. Olfactory information,
however, passes through the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex
(piriform cortex). The majority of connections are from one area of
the cortex to another, rather than from subcortical areas; Braitenberg
and Schuz (1998) claim that in primary sensory areas, at the cortical
level where the input fibers terminate, up to 20% of the synapses
are supplied by extracortical afferents but that in other areas and
other layers the percentage is likely to be much lower.[66]
The whole of the cerebral cortex was divided into 52 different areas in an early presentation by Korbinian
Brodmann. These areas known as Brodmann areas, are based on their cytoarchitecture but also relate to
various functions. An example is Brodmann area 17 which is the primary visual cortex.

Connections
Cortical areas
Motor and sensory regions of the
cerebral cortex
In more general terms the cortex is typically described as comprising three parts: sensory, motor, and
association areas.
The sensory areas are the cortical areas that receive and process
information from the senses. Parts of the cortex that receive sensory
inputs from the thalamus are called primary sensory areas. The
senses of vision, hearing, and touch are served by the primary
visual cortex, primary auditory cortex and primary somatosensory
cortex respectively. In general, the two hemispheres receive
information from the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. For
example, the right primary somatosensory cortex receives
information from the left limbs, and the right visual cortex receives
information from the left visual field. The organization of sensory
maps in the cortex reflects that of the corresponding sensing organ,
in what is known as a topographic map. Neighboring points in the
primary visual cortex, for example, correspond to neighboring
points in the retina. This topographic map is called a retinotopic
map. In the same way, there exists a tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex and a somatotopic map in
the primary sensory cortex. This last topographic map of the body onto the posterior central gyrus has been
illustrated as a deformed human representation, the somatosensory homunculus, where the size of different
body parts reflects the relative density of their innervation. Areas with much sensory innervation, such as
the fingertips and the lips, require more cortical area to process finer sensation.
The motor areas are located in both hemispheres of the cortex. The motor areas are very closely related to
the control of voluntary movements, especially fine fragmented movements performed by the hand. The
right half of the motor area controls the left side of the body, and vice versa.
Two areas of the cortex are commonly referred to as motor:
Primary motor cortex, which executes voluntary movements [67]
Supplementary motor areas and premotor cortex, which select voluntary movements.[68]
In addition, motor functions have been described for:
Posterior parietal cortex, which guides voluntary movements in space
Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which decides which voluntary movements to make according
to higher-order instructions, rules, and self-generated thoughts.
Just underneath the cerebral cortex are interconnected subcortical masses of grey matter called basal ganglia
(or nuclei). The basal ganglia receive input from the substantia nigra of the midbrain and motor areas of the
cerebral cortex, and send signals back to both of these locations. They are involved in motor control. They
are found lateral to the thalamus. The main components of the basal ganglia are the caudate nucleus, the
putamen, the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, the nucleus accumbens, and the subthalamic nucleus.
Sensory areas
Motor areas
Cortical areas involved in speech
processing.
The putamen and globus pallidus are also collectively known as the lentiform nucleus, because together
they form a lens-shaped body. The putamen and caudate nucleus are also collectively called the corpus
striatum after their striped appearance.[69][70]
The association areas are the parts of the cerebral cortex that do not
belong to the primary regions. They function to produce a
meaningful perceptual experience of the world, enable us to interact
effectively, and support abstract thinking and language. The
parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes - all located in the posterior
part of the cortex - integrate sensory information and information
stored in memory. The frontal lobe or prefrontal association
complex is involved in planning actions and movement, as well as
abstract thought. Globally, the association areas are organized as
distributed networks.[71] Each network connects areas distributed
across widely spaced regions of the cortex. Distinct networks are positioned adjacent to one another
yielding a complex series of interwoven networks. The specific organization of the association networks is
debated with evidence for interactions, hierarchical relationships, and competition between networks.
In humans, association networks are particularly important to language function. In the past it was theorized
that language abilities are localized in Broca's area in areas of the left inferior frontal gyrus, BA44 and
BA45, for language expression and in Wernicke's area BA22, for language reception. However, the
processes of language expression and reception have been shown to occur in areas other than just those
structures around the lateral sulcus, including the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and pons.[72]
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, show as a marker, an atrophy of the grey matter of
the cerebral cortex.[74]
Other diseases of the central nervous system include neurological disorders such as epilepsy, movement
disorders, and different types of aphasia (difficulties in speech expression or comprehension).
Brain damage from disease or trauma, can involve damage to a specific lobe such as in frontal lobe disorder,
and associated functions will be affected. The blood-brain barrier that serves to protect the brain from
infection can become compromised allowing entry to pathogens.
The developing fetus is susceptible to a range of environmental factors that can cause birth defects and
problems in later development. Maternal alcohol consumption for example can cause fetal alcohol spectrum
disorder.[75] Other factors that can cause neurodevelopment disorders are toxicants such as drugs, and
exposure to radiation as from X-rays. Infections can also affect the development of the cortex. A viral
infection is one of the causes of lissencephaly, which results in a smooth cortex without gyrification.

There are a number of genetic mutations that can cause a wide range of genetic disorders of the cerebral
cortex, including microcephaly, schizencephaly and types of lissencephaly.[77] Chromosome abnormalities
can also result causing a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Rett
syndrome.
MCPH1 codes for microcephalin, and disorders in this and in ASPM are associated with microcephaly.[77]
Mutations in the gene NBS1 that codes for nibrin can cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome, characterised by
microcephaly.[77]
Mutations in EMX2,[78] and COL4A1 are associated with schizencephaly,[79] a condition marked by the
absence of large parts of the cerebral hemispheres.
In 1909, Korbinian Brodmann distinguished different areas of the neocortex based on cytoarchitectural
difference and divided the cerebral cortex into 52 regions.[80]
Rafael Lorente de No, a student of Santiago Ramon y Cajal identified more than 40 different types of
cortical neurons based on the distribution of their dendrites and axons.[80]

History
Other animals
The cerebral cortex is derived from the pallium, a layered structure found in the forebrain of all vertebrates.
The basic form of the pallium is a cylindrical layer enclosing fluid-filled ventricles. Around the
circumference of the cylinder are four zones, the dorsal pallium, medial pallium, ventral pallium, and lateral
pallium, which are thought to be homologous to the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory
cortex, respectively.
In avian brains, evidence suggests the avian pallium's neuroarchitecture to be reminiscent of the mammalian
cerebral cortex.[81] The avian pallium has also been suggested to be an equivalent neural basis for
consciousness.[82][83]
Until recently no counterpart to the cerebral cortex had been recognized in invertebrates. However, a study
published in the journal Cell in 2010, based on gene expression profiles, reported strong affinities between
the cerebral cortex and the mushroom bodies of the ragworm Platynereis dumerilii.[84] Mushroom bodies
are structures in the brains of many types of worms and arthropods that are known to play important roles in
learning and memory; the genetic evidence indicates a common evolutionary origin, and therefore indicates
that the origins of the earliest precursors of the cerebral cortex date back to the Precambrian era.

Details
Identifiers
Cranial nerves
Cranial nerves are the nerves that emerge directly from the brain
(including the brainstem), of which there are conventionally
considered twelve pairs. Cranial nerves relay information
between the brain and parts of the body, primarily to and from
regions of the head and neck, including the special senses of
vision, taste, smell, and hearing.[1]
The cranial nerves emerge from the central nervous system above
the level of the first vertebra of the vertebral column.[2] Each
cranial nerve is paired and is present on both sides. There are
conventionally twelve pairs of cranial nerves, which are
described with Roman numerals I-XII. Some considered there to
be thirteen pairs of cranial nerves, including cranial nerve zero.
The numbering of the cranial nerves is based on the order in
which they emerge from the brain and brainstem, from front to
back.[2]
The terminal nerves (0), olfactory nerves (I) and optic nerves (II)
emerge from the cerebrum, and the remaining ten pairs arise from
the brainstem, which is the lower part of the brain.[3]
The cranial nerves are considered components of the peripheral
nervous system (PNS),[3] although on a structural level the
olfactory (I), optic (II), and trigeminal (V) nerves are more
accurately considered part of the central nervous system
(CNS).[4]
The cranial nerves are in contrast to spinal nerves, which emerge
from segments of the spinal cord.[3]
Most typically, humans are considered to have twelve pairs of
cranial nerves (I-XII), with the terminal nerve (0) more recently
canonized.[2][5] The nerves are: the olfactory nerve (I), the optic
nerve (II), oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), trigeminal
nerve 
(V), 
abducens 
nerve 
(VI), 
facial

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), glossopharyngeal nerve (IX),
vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI), and the hypoglossal
nerve (XII).
Cranial nerves are generally named according to their structure or
function. For example, the olfactory nerve (I) supplies smell, and
the facial nerve (VII) supplies the muscles of the face. Because
Latin was the lingua franca of the study of anatomy when the
nerves were first documented, recorded, and discussed, many
nerves maintain Latin or Greek names, including the trochlear
nerve (IV), named according to its structure, as it supplies a
muscle that attaches to a pulley (Greek: trochlea). The trigeminal
nerve (V) is named in accordance with its three components
(Latin: trigeminus meaning triplets),[6] and the vagus nerve (X) is
named for its wandering course (Latin: vagus).[7]
Cranial nerves are numbered based on their position from front to
back (rostral-caudal) of their position on the brain,[8] as, when
viewing the forebrain and brainstem from below, they are often
visible in their numeric order. For example, the olfactory nerves
(I) and optic nerves (II) arise from the base of the forebrain, and
the other nerves, III to XII, arise from the brainstem.[8]
Cranial nerves have paths within and outside the skull. The paths
within the skull are called ""intracranial"" and the paths outside the
skull are called ""extracranial"". There are many holes in the skull called ""foramina"" by which the nerves can
exit the skull. All cranial nerves are paired, which means they occur on both the right and left sides of the
body. The muscle, skin, or additional function supplied by a nerve, on the same side of the body as the side
it originates from, is an ipsilateral function. If the function is on the opposite side to the origin of the nerve,
this is known as a contralateral function.[9]
Grossly, all cranial nerves have a nucleus. With the exception of the olfactory nerve (I) and optic nerve (II),
all the nuclei are present in the brainstem.[2]
The midbrain has the nuclei of the oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV); the pons has the nuclei
of the trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII); and
the medulla has the nuclei of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and
hypoglossal nerve (XII).[10] The olfactory nerve (I) emerges from the olfactory bulb, and depending slightly
on division the optic nerve (II) is considered to emerge from the lateral geniculate nuclei.[10]

after the order in which they emerge
Because each nerve may have several functions, the nerve
fibres that make up the nerve may collect in more than one
nucleus. For example, the trigeminal nerve (V), which has a
sensory and a motor role, has at least four nuclei.[10][11]
With the exception of the olfactory nerve (I) and optic nerve
(II), the cranial nerves emerge from the brainstem. The
oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV) emerge from
the midbrain, the trigeminal (V), abducens (VI), facial (VII)
and vestibulocochlear (VIII) from the pons, and the
glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), accessory (XI) and
hypoglossal (XII) emerge from the medulla.[12]
The olfactory nerve (I) and optic nerve (II) emerge separately.
The olfactory nerves emerge from the olfactory bulbs on either
side of the crista galli, a bony projection below the frontal
lobe, and the optic nerves (II) emerge from the lateral
colliculus, swellings on either side of the temporal lobes of the
brain.[12]
The cranial nerves give rise to a number of ganglia, collections
of the cell bodies of neurons in the nerves that are outside of
the brain. These ganglia are both parasympathetic and sensory
ganglia.[10]
The sensory ganglia of the cranial nerves, directly correspond
to the dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves and are known as
cranial nerve ganglia.[8] Sensory ganglia exist for nerves with
sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X.[2] There are also a
number of parasympathetic cranial nerve ganglia. Sympathetic
ganglia supplying the head and neck reside in the upper
regions of the sympathetic trunk, and do not belong to the
cranial nerves.[10]
The ganglion of the sensory nerves, which are similar in
structure to the dorsal root ganglion of the spinal cord,
include:[13]
The trigeminal ganglia of the trigeminal nerve (V),
which occupies a space in the dura mater called
Meckel's cave. This ganglion contains only the
sensory fibres of the trigeminal nerve.
The geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve (VII),
which occurs just after the nerve enters the facial
canal.

Additional ganglia for nerves with parasympathetic function
exist, and include the ciliary ganglion of the oculomotor nerve
(III), the pterygopalatine ganglion of the maxillary nerve (V2),
the submandibular ganglion of the lingual nerve, a branch of
the facial nerve (VII), and the otic ganglion of the
glossopharyngeal nerve (IX).[14]
After emerging from the brain, the cranial nerves travel within the skull, and some must leave it in order to
reach their destinations. Often the nerves pass through holes in the skull, called foramina, as they travel to
their destinations. Other nerves pass through bony canals, longer pathways enclosed by bone. These
foramina and canals may contain more than one cranial nerve and may also contain blood vessels.[13]
The terminal nerve (0), is a thin network of fibers associated with the dura and lamina
terminalis running rostral to the olfactory nerve, with projections through the cribriform plate.
The olfactory nerve (I), passes through perforations in the cribriform plate part of the ethmoid
bone. The nerve fibres end in the upper nasal cavity.
The optic nerve (II) passes through the optic foramen in the sphenoid bone as it travels to the
eye.
The oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), abducens nerve (VI) and the ophthalmic
branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) travel through the cavernous sinus into the superior
orbital fissure, passing out of the skull into the orbit.
Exiting the skull and extracranial course
Schematic 3D model of the cranial
nerves
The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (V2) passes through foramen rotundum in the
sphenoid bone.
The mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3) passes through foramen ovale of the
sphenoid bone.
The facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) both enter the internal auditory canal
in the temporal bone. The facial nerve then reaches the side of the face by using the
stylomastoid foramen, also in the temporal bone. Its fibers then spread out to reach and
control all of the muscles of facial expression. The vestibulocochlear nerve reaches the
organs that control balance and hearing in the temporal bone and therefore does not reach
the external surface of the skull.
The glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X) and accessory nerve (XI) all leave the skull via the
jugular foramen to enter the neck. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides sensation to the
upper throat and the back of the tongue, the vagus supplies the muscles in the larynx and
continues downward to supply parasympathetic supply to the chest and abdomen. The
accessory nerve controls the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles in the neck and
shoulder.
The hypoglossal nerve (XII) exits the skull using the
hypoglossal canal in the occipital bone.
The cranial nerves are formed from the contribution of two
specialized embryonic cell populations, cranial neural crest and
ectodermal placodes. The components of the sensory nervous
system of the head are derived from the neural crest and from an
embryonic cell population developing in close proximity, the cranial
sensory placodes (the olfactory, lens, otic, trigeminal, epibranchial and paratympanic placodes). The dual
origin cranial nerves are summarized in the following table:[15]

ganglion of the accessory nerve. The cranial part of the accessory nerve sends occasional branches to the
superior ganglion of the vagus nerve.
The cranial nerves provide motor and sensory supply mainly to the structures within the head and neck. The
sensory supply includes both ""general"" sensation such as temperature and touch, and ""special"" senses such
as taste, vision, smell, balance and hearing.[11] The vagus nerve (X) provides sensory and autonomic
(parasympathetic) supply to structures in the neck and also to most of the organs in the chest and
abdomen.[3][2]
The terminal nerve (0) may not have a role in humans,[3] although it has been implicated in hormonal
responses to smell, sexual response and mate selection.[5]
The olfactory nerve (I) conveys information giving rise to the sense of smell.[16]
Damage to the olfactory nerve (I) can cause an inability to smell (anosmia), a distortion in the sense of smell
(parosmia), or a distortion or lack of taste.[16][17]
The optic nerve (II) transmits visual information.[2]
Damage to the optic nerve (II) affects specific aspects of vision that depend on the location of the damage.
A person may not be able to see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have
difficulty seeing objects from their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is
involved. Inflammation (optic neuritis) may impact the sharpness of vision or colour detection[16]
The oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI) coordinate eye movement. The
oculomotor nerve (III) controls all muscles of the eye except for the superior oblique muscle controlled by
the trochlear nerve (IV), and the lateral rectus muscle controlled by the abducens nerve (VI). This means the
ability of the eye to look down and inwards is controlled by the trochlear nerve (IV), the ability to look
outwards is controlled by the abducens nerve (VI), and all other movements are controlled by the
oculomotor nerve (III)[16]
Damage to these nerves may affect the movement of the eye. Damage may result in double vision (diplopia)
because the movements of the eyes are not synchronized. Abnormalities of visual movement may also be
seen on examination, such as jittering (nystagmus).[17]
Function
Terminal nerve (0)
Smell (I)
Vision (II)
Eye movement (III, IV, VI)
The oculomotor (III), troclear (IV) and
abducens (VI) nerves supply the
muscle of the eye. Damage will
affect the movement of the eye in
various ways, shown here.
Damage to the oculomotor nerve (III) can cause double vision and
inability to coordinate the movements of both eyes (strabismus),
also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis).[18]
Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis
of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion
to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to
alleviate symptoms due to paralysis of one or more of the eye
muscles it controls.[17]
Damage to the trochlear nerve (IV) can also cause double vision
with the eye adducted and elevated.[18] The result will be an eye
which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards
when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the
superior oblique muscle.[17]
Damage to the abducens nerve (VI) can also result in double
vision.[18] This is due to impairment in the lateral rectus muscle,
supplied by the abducens nerve.[17]
The trigeminal nerve (V) and its three main branches the
ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) provide sensation to the skin of the face and also
controls the muscles of chewing.[16]
Damage to the trigeminal nerve leads to loss of sensation in an affected area. Other conditions affecting the
trigeminal nerve (V) include trigeminal neuralgia, herpes zoster, sinusitis pain, presence of a dental abscess,
and cluster headaches.[19][16]
The facial nerve (VII) controls most muscles of facial expression, supplies the sensation of taste from the
front two-thirds of the tongue, and controls the stapedius muscle.[16] Most muscles are supplied by the
cortex on the opposite side of the brain; the exception is the frontalis muscle of the forehead, in which the
left and the right side of the muscle both receive inputs from both sides of the brain.[16]
Damage to the facial nerve (VII) may cause facial palsy. This is where a person is unable to move the
muscles on one or both sides of their face.[16] The most common cause of this is Bell's palsy, the ultimate
cause of which is unknown.[16] Patients with Bell's palsy often have a drooping mouth on the affected side
and often have trouble chewing because the buccinator muscle is affected.[3] The facial nerve is also the
most commonly affected cranial nerve in blunt trauma.[20]
The vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) supplies information relating to balance and hearing via its two
branches, the vestibular and cochlear nerves. The vestibular part is responsible for supplying sensation from
the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear, including information about balance, and is an

important component of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the
head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The
cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing
sound to be heard.[2]
When damaged, the vestibular nerve may give rise to the sensation
of spinning and dizziness (vertigo). Function of the vestibular nerve
may be tested by putting cold and warm water in the ears and
watching eye movements caloric stimulation.[3][17] Damage to the
vestibulocochlear nerve can also present as repetitive and
involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), particularly when the eye
is moving horizontally.[17] Damage to the cochlear nerve will cause
partial or complete deafness in the affected ear.[17]
The glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) supplies the stylopharyngeus
muscle and provides sensation to the oropharynx and back of the
tongue.[3] 
The 
glossopharyngeal 
nerve 
also 
provides
parasympathetic input to the parotid gland.[3]
Damage to the nerve may cause failure of the gag reflex; a failure
may also be seen in damage to the vagus nerve (X).[16]
The vagus nerve (X) provides sensory and parasympathetic supply to
structures in the neck and also to most of the organs in the chest and
abdomen.[2]
Loss of function of the vagus nerve (X) will lead to a loss of parasympathetic
supply to a very large number of structures. Major effects of damage to the
vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated
dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but - if the lesion is located above
the point at which the vagus first branches off - can be indicated by a hoarse
voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal
nerve.[10]
Damage to this nerve may result in difficulties swallowing.[17]
The accessory nerve (XI) supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.[16]
Damage to the accessory nerve (XI) will lead to weakness in the trapezius muscle on the same side as the
damage. The trapezius lifts the shoulder when shrugging, so the affected shoulder will not be able to shrug
and the shoulder blade (scapula) will protrude into a winged position.[3] Depending on the location of the

lesion there may also be weakness
present in the sternocleidomastoid
muscle, which acts to turn the head so
that the face points to the opposite
side.[16]
The hypoglossal nerve (XII) supplies
the intrinsic muscles of the tongue,
controlling tongue movement.[16] The
hypoglossal nerve (XII) is unique in
that it is supplied by the motor
cortices of both hemispheres of the
brain.[17]
Damage to the nerve may lead to
fasciculations or wasting (atrophy) of
the muscles of the tongue. This will

to

When
damaged and extended, the tongue
will move towards the weaker or
damaged side, as shown in the image.[17] The fasciculations of the tongue are sometimes said to look like a
""bag of worms"". Damage to the nerve tract or nucleus will not lead to atrophy or fasciculations, but only
weakness of the muscles on the same side as the damage.[17]
Doctors, neurologists and other medical professionals may conduct a cranial nerve examination as part of a
neurological examination to examine the cranial nerves. This is a highly formalised series of steps involving
specific tests for each nerve.[16] Dysfunction of a nerve identified during testing may point to a problem
with the nerve or of a part of the brain.[16]
A cranial nerve exam starts with observation of the patient, as some cranial nerve lesions may affect the
symmetry of the eyes or face.[16] Vision may be tested by examining the visual fields, or by examining the
retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to
pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.[17] Eye movement is
tested and abnormalities such as nystagmus are observed for. The sensation of the face is tested, and patients
are asked to perform different facial movements, such as puffing out of the cheeks. Hearing is checked by
voice and tuning forks. The patient's uvula is examined. After performing a shrug and head turn, the
patient's tongue function is assessed by various tongue movements.[16]
Tongue movement (XII)
Clinical significance
Examination
Smell is not routinely tested, but if there is suspicion of a change in the sense of smell, each nostril is tested
with substances of known odors such as coffee or soap. Intensely smelling substances, for example
ammonia, may lead to the activation of pain receptors of the trigeminal nerve (V) located in the nasal cavity
and this can confound olfactory testing.[16][17]
Nerves may be compressed because of increased intracranial pressure, a mass effect of an intracerebral
haemorrhage, or tumour that presses against the nerves and interferes with the transmission of impulses
along the nerve.[22] Loss of function of a cranial nerve may sometimes be the first symptom of an
intracranial or skull base cancer.[23]
An increase in intracranial pressure may lead to impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of
the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema).[24] A cancer, such as
an optic nerve glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts
or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend
into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve
(VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the
temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.[22]
The cause of trigeminal neuralgia, in which one side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be
compression of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem.[22] An acoustic neuroma,
particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and
vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.[22][25]
Occlusion of blood vessels that supply the nerves or their nuclei, an ischemic stroke, may cause specific
signs and symptoms relating to the damaged area. If there is a stroke of the midbrain, pons or medulla,
various cranial nerves may be damaged, resulting in dysfunction and symptoms of a number of different
syndromes.[26] Thrombosis, such as a cavernous sinus thrombosis, refers to a clot (thrombus) affecting the
venous drainage from the cavernous sinus, affects the optic (II), oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), ophthalmic
branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) and the abducens nerve (VI).[25]
Inflammation of a cranial nerve can occur as a result of infection, such as viral causes like reactivated herpes
simplex virus, or can occur spontaneously. Inflammation of the facial nerve (VII) may result in Bell's
palsy.[27]

The accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII) cannot be seen, as they are not always present in all
vertebrates.
Multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory process resulting in a loss of the myelin sheathes which surround the
cranial nerves, may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves. Inflammation
may also affect other cranial nerves.[27] Other rarer inflammatory causes affecting the function of multiple
cranial nerves include sarcoidosis, miliary tuberculosis, and inflammation of arteries, such as granulomatosis
with polyangiitis.[25]
Trauma to the skull, disease of bone, such as Paget's disease, and injury to nerves during surgery are other
causes of nerve damage.[25]
The Graeco-Roman anatomist Galen (AD 129-210) named seven pairs of cranial nerves.[7] Much later, in
1664, English anatomist Sir Thomas Willis suggested that there were actually 9 pairs of nerves. Finally, in
1778, German anatomist Samuel Soemmering named the 12 pairs of nerves that are generally accepted
today.[7] However, because many of the nerves emerge from the brain stem as rootlets, there is continual
debate as to how many nerves there actually are, and how they should be grouped.[7] For example, there is
reason to consider both the olfactory (I) and optic (II) nerves to be brain tracts, rather than cranial nerves.[7]
Other
History
Other animals
Cranial nerves are also present in other vertebrates. Other amniotes (non-amphibian tetrapods) have cranial
nerves similar to those of humans. In anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), the accessory nerve (XI) and
hypoglossal nerve (XII) do not exist, with the accessory nerve (XI) being an integral part of the vagus nerve
(X); the hypoglossal nerve (XII) is represented by a variable number of spinal nerves emerging from
vertebral segments fused into the occiput. These two nerves only became discrete nerves in the ancestors of
amniotes.[28] The very small terminal nerve (nerve N or O) exists in humans but may not be functional. In
other animals, it appears to be important to sexual receptivity based on perceptions of pheromones.[3][29]

8,"The neuron contains dendrites that receives information, a cell body called the soma,
and an axon that sends information. Schwann cells make activity move faster down
axon. Synapses allow neurons to activate other neurons. The dendrites receive a
signal, the axon hillock funnels the signal to the initial segment and the initial
segment triggers the activity (action potential) that is sent along the axon towards the
synapse. Please see learnbio.org (https://www.learnbio.org/neuron.html) for
interactive version.
Dendrite
A dendrite (from Greek dendron dendron, ""tree"") or dendron is a branched protoplasmic extension of a
nerve cell that propagates the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the cell body,
or soma, of the neuron from which the dendrites project. Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites
by upstream neurons (usually via their axons) via synapses which are located at various points throughout
the dendritic tree.
Dendrites play a critical role in integrating these synaptic inputs and in determining the extent to which
action potentials are produced by the neuron.[1]
Dendrites are one of two types of protoplasmic protrusions that extrude from the cell body of a neuron, the
other type being an axon. Axons can be distinguished from dendrites by several features including shape,
length, and function. Dendrites often taper off in shape and are shorter, while axons tend to maintain a
constant radius and can be very long. Typically, axons transmit electrochemical signals and dendrites
receive the electrochemical signals, although some types of neurons in certain species lack specialized
axons and transmit signals via their dendrites.[3] Dendrites provide an enlarged surface area to receive
signals from axon terminals of other neurons.[4] The dendrite of a large pyramidal cell receives signals from
about 30,000 presynaptic neurons.[5] Excitatory synapses terminate on dendritic spines, tiny protrusions
from the dendrite with a high density of neurotransmitter receptors. Most inhibitory synapses directly
contact the dendritic shaft.
Structure and function
The extensive dendritic tree of two
hippocampal pyramidal neurons (magenta)
with all incoming synapses genetically
labeled (green spots).[2]
Synaptic activity causes local changes in the electrical
potential across the plasma membrane of the dendrite. This
change in membrane potential will passively spread along
the dendrite, but becomes weaker with distance without an
action potential. To generate an action potential, many
excitatory synapses have to be active at the same time,
leading to strong depolarization of the dendrite and the cell
body (soma). The action potential, which typically starts at
the axon hillock, propagates down the length of the axon to
the axon terminals where it triggers the release of
neurotransmitters, but also backwards into the dendrite
(retrograde propagation), providing an important signal for
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).[4]
Most synapses are axodendritic, involving an axon signaling
to a dendrite. There are also dendrodendritic synapses,
signaling from one dendrite to another.[6] An autapse is a
synapse in which the axon of one neuron transmits signals to
its own dendrite.
The general structure of the dendrite is used to classify
neurons into multipolar, bipolar and unipolar types.
Multipolar neurons are composed of one axon and many
dendritic trees. Pyramidal cells are multipolar cortical
neurons with pyramid-shaped cell bodies and large dendrites
that extend towards the surface of the cortex (apical
dendrite). Bipolar neurons have two main dendrites at
opposing ends of the cell body. Many inhibitory neurons
have this morphology. Unipolar neurons, typical for insects,
have a stalk that extends from the cell body that separates
into two branches with one containing the dendrites and the
other with the terminal buttons. In vertebrates, sensory neurons detecting touch or temperature are
unipolar.[6][7][8] Dendritic branching can be extensive and in some cases is sufficient to receive as many as
100,000 inputs to a single neuron.[4]
The term dendrites was first used in 1889 by Wilhelm His to describe the number of smaller ""protoplasmic
processes"" that were attached to a nerve cell.[9] German anatomist Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters is generally
credited with the discovery of the axon by distinguishing it from the dendrites.
Some of the first intracellular recordings in a nervous system were made in the late 1930s by Kenneth S.
Cole and Howard J. Curtis. Swiss Rudolf Albert von Kolliker and German Robert Remak were the first to
identify and characterize the axonal initial segment. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley also employed the
squid giant axon (1939) and by 1952 they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of
the action potential, leading the formulation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Hodgkin and Huxley were
awarded jointly the Nobel Prize for this work in 1963. The formulas detailing axonal conductance were
History
extended to vertebrates in the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations. Louis-Antoine Ranvier was the first to
describe the gaps or nodes found on axons and for this contribution these axonal features are now
commonly referred to as the Nodes of Ranvier. Santiago Ramon y Cajal, a Spanish anatomist, proposed that
axons were the output components of neurons.[10] He also proposed that neurons were discrete cells that
communicated with each other via specialized junctions, or spaces, between cells, now known as a synapse.
Ramon y Cajal improved a silver staining process known as Golgi's method, which had been developed by
his rival, Camillo Golgi.[11]
During the development of dendrites, several factors can
influence differentiation. These include modulation of
sensory input, environmental pollutants, body temperature,
and drug use.[12] For example, rats raised in dark
environments were found to have a reduced number of
spines in pyramidal cells located in the primary visual
cortex and a marked change in distribution of dendrite
branching in layer 4 stellate cells.[13] Experiments done in
vitro and in vivo have shown that the presence of afferents
and input activity per se can modulate the patterns in
which dendrites differentiate.[14]
Little is known about the process by which dendrites orient themselves in vivo and are compelled to create
the intricate branching pattern unique to each specific neuronal class. One theory on the mechanism of
dendritic arbor development is the Synaptotropic Hypothesis. The synaptotropic hypothesis proposes that
input from a presynaptic to a postsynaptic cell (and maturation of excitatory synaptic inputs) eventually can
change the course of synapse formation at dendritic and axonal arbors.[15]
This synapse formation is required for the development of neuronal structure in the functioning brain. A
balance between metabolic costs of dendritic elaboration and the need to cover receptive field presumably
determine the size and shape of dendrites. A complex array of extracellular and intracellular cues modulates
dendrite development including transcription factors, receptor-ligand interactions, various signaling
pathways, local translational machinery, cytoskeletal elements, Golgi outposts and endosomes. These
contribute to the organization of the dendrites on individual cell bodies and the placement of these dendrites
in the neuronal circuitry. For example, it was shown that b-actin zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1)
contributes to proper dendritic branching.
Other important transcription factors involved in the morphology of dendrites include CUT, Abrupt, Collier,
Spineless, ACJ6/drifter, CREST, NEUROD1, CREB, NEUROG2 etc. Secreted proteins and cell surface
receptors includes neurotrophins and tyrosine kinase receptors, BMP7, Wnt/dishevelled, EPHB 1-3,
Semaphorin/plexin-neuropilin, slit-robo, netrin-frazzled, reelin. Rac, CDC42 and RhoA serve as
cytoskeletal regulators and the motor protein includes KIF5, dynein, LIS1. Important secretory and
endocytic pathways controlling the dendritic development include DAR3 /SAR1, DAR2/Sec23,
Dendrite development
DAR6/Rab1 etc. All these molecules interplay with each other in controlling dendritic morphogenesis
including the acquisition of type specific dendritic arborization, the regulation of dendrite size and the
organization of dendrites emanating from different neurons.[1][16]
Dendritic arborization, also known as dendritic branching, is a multi-step biological process by which
neurons form new dendritic trees and branches to create new synapses.[1] Dendrites in many organisms
assume different morphological patterns of branching. The morphology of dendrites such as branch density
and grouping patterns are highly correlated to the function of the neuron. Malformation of dendrites is also
tightly correlated to impaired nervous system function.[14]
Branching morphologies may assume an adendritic structure (not having a branching structure, or not tree-
like), or a tree-like radiation structure. Tree-like arborization patterns can be spindled (where two dendrites
radiate from opposite poles of a cell body with few branches, see bipolar neurons ), spherical (where
dendrites radiate in a part or in all directions from a cell body, see cerebellar granule cells), laminar (where
dendrites can either radiate planarly, offset from cell body by one or more stems, or multi-planarly, see
retinal horizontal cells, retinal ganglion cells, retinal amacrine cells respectively), cylindrical (where
dendrites radiate in all directions in a cylinder, disk-like fashion, see pallidal neurons), conical (dendrites
radiate like a cone away from cell body, see pyramidal cells), or fanned (where dendrites radiate like a flat
fan as in Purkinje cells).
The structure and branching of a neuron's dendrites, as well as the availability and variation of voltage-
gated ion conductance, strongly influences how the neuron integrates the input from other neurons. This
integration is both temporal, involving the summation of stimuli that arrive in rapid succession, as well as
spatial, entailing the aggregation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from separate branches.[17]
Dendrites were once thought to merely convey electrical stimulation passively. This passive transmission
means that voltage changes measured at the cell body are the result of activation of distal synapses
propagating the electric signal towards the cell body without the aid of voltage-gated ion channels. Passive
cable theory describes how voltage changes at a particular location on a dendrite transmit this electrical
signal through a system of converging dendrite segments of different diameters, lengths, and electrical
properties. Based on passive cable theory one can track how changes in a neuron's dendritic morphology
impacts the membrane voltage at the cell body, and thus how variation in dendrite architectures affects the
overall output characteristics of the neuron.[18][19]
Action potentials initiated at the axon hillock propagate back into the dendritic arbor. These back-
propagating action potentials depolarize the dendritic membrane and provide a crucial signal for synapse
modulation and long-term potentiation. Back-propagation is not completely passive, but modulated by the
presence of dendritic voltage-gated potassium channels. Furthermore, in certain types of neurons, a train of
back-propagating action potentials can induce a calcium action potential (a dendritic spike) at dendritic
initiation zones.[20][21]
Types of dendritic patterns
Electrical properties
Plasticity
Dendrites themselves appear to be capable of plastic changes during the adult life of animals, including
invertebrates.[22] Neuronal dendrites have various compartments known as functional units that are able to
compute incoming stimuli. These functional units are involved in processing input and are composed of the
subdomains of dendrites such as spines, branches, or groupings of branches. Therefore, plasticity that leads
to changes in the dendrite structure will affect communication and processing in the cell. During
development, dendrite morphology is shaped by intrinsic programs within the cell's genome and extrinsic
factors such as signals from other cells. But in adult life, extrinsic signals become more influential and cause
more significant changes in dendrite structure compared to intrinsic signals during development. In females,
the dendritic structure can change as a result of physiological conditions induced by hormones during
periods such as pregnancy, lactation, and following the estrous cycle. This is particularly visible in
pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where the density of dendrites can vary up to
30%.[14]
Recent experimental observations suggest that adaptation is performed in the neuronal dendritic trees, where
the timescale of adaptation was observed to be as low as several seconds only.[23][24] Certain machine
learning architectures based on dendritic trees have shown to simplify the learning algorithm without
affecting performance.[25]

Anatomical terminology
Layers of the Alimentary Canal. The
wall of the alimentary canal has four
basic tissue layers: the mucosa,
submucosa, muscularis, and serosa.
Enteric nervous system
The enteric nervous system (ENS) or intrinsic nervous
system is one of the three main divisions of the autonomic
nervous system (ANS), the other being the sympathetic (SNS)
and parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), and consists of a
mesh-like system of neurons that governs the function of the
gastrointestinal tract.[1] It is capable of acting independently of
the SNS and PSNS, although it may be influenced by them.
The ENS is nicknamed the ""second brain"".[2][3] It is derived
from neural crest cells.[4][5]
The enteric nervous system is capable of operating
independently of the brain and spinal cord,[6] but is thought to
rely on innervation from the vagus nerve and prevertebral
ganglia in healthy subjects. However, studies have shown that
the system is operable with a severed vagus nerve.[7] The
neurons of the enteric nervous system control the motor
functions of the system, in addition to the secretion of
gastrointestinal enzymes. These neurons communicate through
many neurotransmitters similar to the CNS, including
acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. The large presence of
serotonin and dopamine in the intestines are key areas of
research for neurogastroenterology.[8][9][10]
The enteric nervous system in humans consists of some 500
million neurons[11] (including the various types of Dogiel
cells),[1][12] 0.5% of the number of neurons in the brain, five times
as many as the one hundred million neurons in the human spinal
cord,[13] and about 2/3 as many as in the whole nervous system of a
cat. The enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the
gastrointestinal system, beginning in the esophagus and extending
down to the anus.[13]
The neurons of the ENS are collected into two types of ganglia:
myenteric (Auerbach's) and submucosal (Meissner's) plexuses.[14]
Myenteric plexuses are located between the inner and outer layers
of the muscularis externa, while submucosal plexuses are located in
the submucosa.
Structure
Auerbach's plexus
Auerbach's plexus, also known as the myenteric plexus, is a collection of fibers and postganglionic
autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the
gastrointestinal tract. It was discovered and named by German neuropathologist Leopold Auerbach. These
neurons provide motor inputs to both layers of the muscularis externa and provide both parasympathetic and
sympathetic input. The anatomy of the plexus is similar to the anatomy of the central nervous system. The
plexus includes sensory receptors, such as chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors, that are used to provide
sensory input to the interneurons in the enteric nervous system. The plexus is the parasympathetic nucleus
of origin for the vagus nerve and communicates with the medulla oblongata through both the anterior and
posterior vagal nerves.
The submucosal plexus (also known as Meissner's plexus) is found in the submucosal layer of the
gastrointestinal tract.[15] It was discovered and named by German physiologist Georg Meissner. It functions
as a pathway for the innervation in the mucosa layer of the gastrointestinal wall.
The ENS is capable of autonomous functions[16] like the coordination of reflexes; although it receives
considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system, it can and does operate independently of the
brain and the spinal cord.[17] Its study is the focus of neurogastroenterology.
The enteric nervous system has been described as a ""second brain"" for several reasons. The enteric nervous
system can operate autonomously. It normally communicates with the central nervous system (CNS)
through the parasympathetic (e.g., via the vagus nerve) and sympathetic (e.g., via the prevertebral ganglia)
nervous systems. However, vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed, the enteric
nervous system continues to function.[7]
In vertebrates, the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons, afferent neurons, and interneurons, all
of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in
the absence of CNS input. The sensory neurons report on mechanical and chemical conditions. Through
intestinal muscles, the motor neurons control peristalsis and churning of intestinal contents. Other neurons
control the secretion of enzymes. The enteric nervous system also makes use of more than
30  neurotransmitters, most of which are identical to the ones found in CNS, such as acetylcholine,
dopamine, and serotonin. More than 90% of the body's serotonin lies in the gut, as well as about 50% of the
body's dopamine, which is currently being studied to further our understanding of its utility in the
brain.[18][19][20]
The enteric nervous system has the capacity to alter its response depending on such factors as bulk and
nutrient composition.[21] In addition, the ENS contains support cells which are similar to astroglia of the
brain and a diffusion barrier around the capillaries surrounding ganglia which is similar to the blood-brain
barrier of cerebral blood vessels.[22]

Peristalsis
A simplified image showing
peristalsis
Peristalsis is a series of radially symmetrical contractions and
relaxations of muscles which propagate down a muscular tube. In
humans and other mammals, peristalsis is found in the smooth
muscles of the digestive tract to propel contents through the digestive
system. The word is derived from New Latin and comes from the
Greek peristallein, ""to wrap around,"" from peri-, ""around"" + stallein,
""to place"". Peristalsis was discovered in 1899 by the work of
physiologists William Bayliss and Ernest Starling. Working on the
small intestines of dogs, they found that the response of increasing the
pressure in the intestine caused the contraction of the muscle wall
above the point of stimulation and the relaxation of the muscle wall
below the point of stimulation.[23][6]
Segmentation contractions are the contractions in intestines carried
out by the smooth muscle walls. Unlike peristalsis, which involves
the contraction and relaxation of muscles in one direction,
segmentation occurs simultaneously in both directions as the circular
muscles alternatively contract. This allows for thorough mixing of
intestinal contents, known as chyme, to allow greater absorption.
The secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin and secretin, is regulated through cholinergic
neurons residing in the walls of the digestive tract. Hormone secretion is controlled by the vagovagal reflex,
where the neurons in the digestive tract communicate through both afferent and efferent pathways with the
vagus nerve.[24]
Neurogastroenterology encompasses the study of the brain, the gut, and their interactions with relevance
to the understanding and management of gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders.
Specifically, neurogastroenterology focuses on the functions, malfunctions, and the malformations of the
sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric divisions of the digestive tract.[25] The term also describes a
medical sub-specialism of gastroenterology dedicated to the treatment of motility and functional
gastrointestinal disorders.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders
Functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are a class of gastrointestinal disorders where there is a
malfunction in the normal activities of the gastrointestinal tract, but there are no structural abnormalities that
can explain the cause. There are rarely any tests that can detect the presence of these disorders. Clinical
research in neurogastroenterology focuses mainly on the study of common functional gastrointestinal
disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, the most common functional GI disorder.[26]
Motility 
disorders 
are 
the 
second 
classification 
of 
gastrointestinal 
disorder 
studied 
by
neurogastroenterologists. Motility disorders are divided by what they affect, with four regions: The
esophagus, the stomach, the small intestines, and the large intestines. Clinical research in
neurogastroenterology focuses mainly on the study of common motility disorders such as gastroesophageal
reflux disease, the damage of the mucosa of the esophagus caused by rising stomach acid through the lower
esophageal sphincter.[27]
ENS function can be damaged by ischemia.[28] Transplantation, previously described as a theoretical
possibility,[29] has been a clinical reality in the United States since 2011 and is regularly performed at some
hospitals.

Glia
Glia, also called glial cells (gliocytes) or neuroglia, are non-
neuronal cells in the central nervous system (brain and spinal
cord) and the peripheral nervous system that do not produce
electrical impulses. The neuroglia make up more than one half
the volume of neural tissue in the human body.[1] They
maintain homeostasis, form myelin in the peripheral nervous
system, and provide support and protection for neurons.[2] In
the central nervous system, glial cells include oligodendrocytes,
astrocytes, ependymal cells and microglia, and in the peripheral
nervous system they include Schwann cells and satellite cells.
They have four main functions:
to surround neurons and hold them in place
to supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons
to insulate one neuron from another
to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons.
They also play a role in neurotransmission and synaptic
connections,[3] and in physiological processes such as
breathing.[4][5][6] While glia were thought to outnumber
neurons by a ratio of 10:1, recent studies using newer methods
and reappraisal of historical quantitative evidence suggests an
overall ratio of less than 1:1, with substantial variation between
different brain tissues.[7][8]
Glial cells have far more cellular diversity and functions than
neurons, and glial cells can respond to and manipulate
neurotransmission in many ways. Additionally, they can affect
both the preservation and consolidation of memories.[1]

Astrocytes can be identified in culture
because, unlike other mature glia, they
express glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP)
Glia were discovered in 1856, by the pathologist Rudolf
Virchow in his search for a ""connective tissue"" in the brain.[9]
The term derives from Greek glia and gloia ""glue""[10]
(English: /'gli:@/ or /'glaI@/), and suggests the original
impression that they were the glue of the nervous system.

Different types of neuroglia
Location
Name
Description
CNS
Astrocytes
The most abundant type of
macroglial 
cell 
in 
the
CNS,[11] astrocytes (also
called 
astroglia) 
have
numerous projections that
link neurons to their blood
supply while forming the
blood-brain barrier. They
regulate 
the 
external
chemical environment of
neurons 
by 
removing
excess 
potassium 
ions,
and 
recycling
neurotransmitters released
during 
synaptic
transmission. 
Astrocytes
may 
regulate
vasoconstriction 
and
vasodilation by producing
substances 
such 
as
arachidonic acid, whose
metabolites 
are
vasoactive.
Astrocytes 
signal 
each
other using ATP. The gap
junctions (also known as
electrical 
synapses)
between astrocytes allow
the messenger molecule
IP3 to diffuse from one
astrocyte to another. IP3
activates calcium channels
on 
cellular 
organelles,
releasing calcium into the
cytoplasm. This calcium
may 
stimulate 
the
production of more IP3 and
cause 
release 
of ATP
through channels in the
membrane 
made 
of
pannexins. The net effect
is a calcium wave that
propagates from cell to
cell. Extracellular release
of ATP, and consequent activation of purinergic receptors on other
astrocytes, may also mediate calcium waves in some cases.
In general, there are two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and
fibrous, similar in function but distinct in morphology and
distribution. Protoplasmic astrocytes have short, thick, highly
branched processes and are typically found in gray matter. Fibrous
astrocytes have long, thin, less-branched processes and are more
commonly found in white matter.
It has recently been shown that astrocyte activity is linked to blood
flow in the brain, and that this is what is actually being measured in
fMRI.[12] They also have been involved in neuronal circuits playing
an inhibitory role after sensing changes in extracellular calcium.[13]
CNS
Oligodendrocytes
Oligodendrocytes are cells that coat axons in the CNS with their
cell membrane, forming a specialized membrane differentiation
called myelin, producing the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath
provides insulation to the axon that allows electrical signals to
propagate more efficiently.[14]
CNS
Ependymal cells
Ependymal cells, also named ependymocytes, line the spinal cord
and the ventricular system of the brain. These cells are involved in
the creation and secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and beat
their cilia to help circulate the CSF and make up the blood-CSF
barrier. They are also thought to act as neural stem cells.[15]
CNS
Radial glia
Radial glia cells arise from neuroepithelial cells after the onset of
neurogenesis. Their differentiation abilities are more restricted than
those of neuroepithelial cells. In the developing nervous system,
radial glia function both as neuronal progenitors and as a scaffold
upon which newborn neurons migrate. In the mature brain, the
cerebellum and retina retain characteristic radial glial cells. In the
cerebellum, these are Bergmann glia, which regulate synaptic
plasticity. In the retina, the radial Muller cell is the glial cell that
spans the thickness of the retina and, in addition to astroglial
cells,[16] participates in a bidirectional communication with
neurons.[17]
PNS
Schwann cells
Similar in function to oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells provide
myelination to axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). They
also have phagocytotic activity and clear cellular debris that allows
for regrowth of PNS neurons.[18]
PNS
Satellite cells
Satellite glial cells are small cells that surround neurons in
sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic ganglia.[19] These
cells help regulate the external chemical environment. Like
astrocytes, they are interconnected by gap junctions and respond
to ATP by elevating the intracellular concentration of calcium ions.
They are highly sensitive to injury and inflammation and appear to
contribute to pathological states, such as chronic pain.[20]
PNS
Enteric glial cells
Are found in the intrinsic ganglia of the digestive system. Glia cells
are thought to have many roles in the enteric system, some related
to homeostasis and muscular digestive processes.[21]
Microglia
23-week fetal brain culture astrocyte
Microglia are specialized macrophages capable of phagocytosis that protect neurons of the central nervous
system.[22] They are derived from the earliest wave of mononuclear cells that originate in yolk sac blood
islands early in development, and colonize the brain shortly after the neural precursors begin to
differentiate.[23]
These cells are found in all regions of the brain and spinal cord. Microglial cells are small relative to
macroglial cells, with changing shapes and oblong nuclei. They are mobile within the brain and multiply
when the brain is damaged. In the healthy central nervous system, microglia processes constantly sample all
aspects of their environment (neurons, macroglia and blood vessels). In a healthy brain, microglia direct the
immune response to brain damage and play an important role in the inflammation that accompanies the
damage. Many diseases and disorders are associated with deficient microglia, such as Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease and ALS.
Pituicytes from the posterior pituitary are glial cells with characteristics in common to astrocytes.[24]
Tanycytes in the median eminence of the hypothalamus are a type of ependymal cell that descend from
radial glia and line the base of the third ventricle.[25] Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, contains
numerous glial types that are functionally similar to mammalian glia but are nonetheless classified
differently.[26]
In general, neuroglial cells are smaller than neurons. There are approximately 85 billion glia cells in the
human brain,[8] about the same number as neurons.[8] Glial cells make up about half the total volume of the
brain and spinal cord.[27] The glia to neuron-ratio varies from one part of the brain to another. The glia to
neuron-ratio in the cerebral cortex is 3.72 (60.84 billion glia (72%); 16.34 billion neurons), while that of the
cerebellum is only 0.23 (16.04 billion glia; 69.03 billion neurons). The ratio in the cerebral cortex gray
matter is 1.48, with 3.76 for the gray and white matter combined.[27] The ratio of the basal ganglia,
diencephalon and brainstem combined is 11.35.[27]
The total number of glia cells in the human brain is distributed into the different types with oligodendrocytes
being the most frequent (45-75%), followed by astrocytes (19-40%) and microglia (about 10% or less).[8]
Most glia are derived from ectodermal tissue of the developing
embryo, in particular the neural tube and crest. The exception is
microglia, which are derived from hematopoietic stem cells. In the
adult, microglia are largely a self-renewing population and are
distinct from macrophages and monocytes, which infiltrate an
injured and diseased CNS.

Development
In the central nervous system, glia develop from the ventricular zone of the neural tube. These glia include
the oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and astrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system, glia derive from
the neural crest. These PNS glia include Schwann cells in nerves and satellite glial cells in ganglia.
Glia retain the ability to undergo cell divisions in adulthood, whereas most neurons cannot. The view is
based on the general inability of the mature nervous system to replace neurons after an injury, such as a
stroke or trauma, where very often there is a substantial proliferation of glia, or gliosis, near or at the site of
damage. However, detailed studies have found no evidence that 'mature' glia, such as astrocytes or
oligodendrocytes, retain mitotic capacity. Only the resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells seem to keep
this ability once the nervous system matures.
Glial cells are known to be capable of mitosis. By contrast, scientific understanding of whether neurons are
permanently post-mitotic,[28] or capable of mitosis,[29][30][31] is still developing. In the past, glia had been
considered to lack certain features of neurons. For example, glial cells were not believed to have chemical
synapses or to release transmitters. They were considered to be the passive bystanders of neural
transmission. However, recent studies have shown this to not be entirely true.[32]
Some glial cells function primarily as the physical support for neurons. Others provide nutrients to neurons
and regulate the extracellular fluid of the brain, especially surrounding neurons and their synapses. During
early embryogenesis, glial cells direct the migration of neurons and produce molecules that modify the
growth of axons and dendrites. Some glial cells display regional diversity in the CNS and their functions
may vary between the CNS regions.[33]
Glia are crucial in the development of the nervous system and in processes such as synaptic plasticity and
synaptogenesis. Glia have a role in the regulation of repair of neurons after injury. In the central nervous
system (CNS), glia suppress repair. Glial cells known as astrocytes enlarge and proliferate to form a scar
and produce inhibitory molecules that inhibit regrowth of a damaged or severed axon. In the peripheral
nervous system (PNS), glial cells known as Schwann cells (or also as neuri-lemmocytes) promote repair.
After axonal injury, Schwann cells regress to an earlier developmental state to encourage regrowth of the
axon. This difference between the CNS and the PNS, raises hopes for the regeneration of nervous tissue in
the CNS. For example, a spinal cord may be able to be repaired following injury or severance.
Oligodendrocytes are found in the CNS and resemble an octopus: they have bulbous cell bodies with up to
fifteen arm-like processes. Each process reaches out to an axon and spirals around it, creating a myelin
sheath. The myelin sheath insulates the nerve fiber from the extracellular fluid and speeds up signal
conduction along the nerve fiber.[34] In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells are responsible for

myelin production. These cells envelop nerve fibers of the PNS by winding repeatedly around them. This
process creates a myelin sheath, which not only aids in conductivity but also assists in the regeneration of
damaged fibers.
Astrocytes are crucial participants in the tripartite synapse.[35][36][37][38] They have several crucial
functions, including clearance of neurotransmitters from within the synaptic cleft, which aids in
distinguishing between separate action potentials and prevents toxic build-up of certain neurotransmitters
such as glutamate, which would otherwise lead to excitotoxicity. Furthermore, astrocytes release
gliotransmitters such as glutamate, ATP, and D-serine in response to stimulation.[39]
While glial cells in the PNS frequently assist in regeneration of
lost neural functioning, loss of neurons in the CNS does not
result in a similar reaction from neuroglia.[18] In the CNS,
regrowth will only happen if the trauma was mild, and not
severe.[40] When severe trauma presents itself, the survival of
the remaining neurons becomes the optimal solution. However,
some studies investigating the role of glial cells in Alzheimer's
disease are beginning to contradict the usefulness of this
feature, and even claim it can ""exacerbate"" the disease.[41] In
addition to affecting the potential repair of neurons in
Alzheimer's disease, scarring and inflammation from glial cells
have been further implicated in the degeneration of neurons
caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[42]
In addition to neurodegenerative diseases, a wide range of harmful exposure, such as hypoxia, or physical
trauma, can lead to the result of physical damage to the CNS.[40] Generally, when damage occurs to the
CNS, glial cells cause apoptosis among the surrounding cellular bodies.[40] Then, there is a large amount of
microglial activity, which results in inflammation, and, finally, there is a heavy release of growth inhibiting
molecules.[40]
Although glial cells and neurons were probably first observed at the same time in the early 19th century,
unlike neurons whose morphological and physiological properties were directly observable for the first
investigators of the nervous system, glial cells had been considered to be merely ""glue"" that held neurons
together until the mid-20th century.[43]
Glia were first described in 1856 by the pathologist Rudolf Virchow in a comment to his 1846 publication
on connective tissue. A more detailed description of glial cells was provided in the 1858 book 'Cellular
Pathology' by the same author.[44]
When markers for different types of cells were analyzed, Albert Einstein's brain was discovered to contain
significantly more glia than normal brains in the left angular gyrus, an area thought to be responsible for
mathematical processing and language.[45] However, out of the total of 28 statistical comparisons between

History
Einstein's brain and the control brains, finding one statistically significant result is not surprising, and the
claim that Einstein's brain is different is not scientific (c.f. Multiple comparisons problem).[46]
Not only does the ratio of glia to neurons increase through evolution, but so does the size of the glia.
Astroglial cells in human brains have a volume 27 times greater than in mouse brains.[47]
These important scientific findings may begin to shift the neurocentric perspective into a more holistic view
of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. For the majority of the twentieth century, scientists
had disregarded glial cells as mere physical scaffolds for neurons. Recent publications have proposed that
the number of glial cells in the brain is correlated with the intelligence of a species.[48] Moreover, evidences
are demonstrating the active role of glia, in particular astroglia, in cognitive processes like learning and
memory[49][50] and, for these reasons, it has been proposed the foundation of a specific field to study these
functions because investigations in this area are still limited due to the dominance of the neurocentric
perspective.[51]

Medulla oblongata (animation)
Medulla oblongata
The medulla oblongata or simply medulla is a long
stem-like structure which makes up the lower part of
the brainstem.[1] It is anterior and partially inferior to
the cerebellum. It is a cone-shaped neuronal mass
responsible for autonomic (involuntary) functions,
ranging from vomiting to sneezing.[2] The medulla
contains the cardiac, respiratory, vomiting and
vasomotor centers, and therefore deals with the
autonomic functions of breathing, heart rate and blood
pressure as well as the sleep-wake cycle.[2]
During embryonic development, the medulla oblongata
develops 
from 
the 
myelencephalon. 
The
myelencephalon is a secondary vesicle which forms
during the maturation of the rhombencephalon, also
referred to as the hindbrain.
The bulb is an archaic term for the medulla
oblongata.[1] In modern clinical usage, the word
bulbar (as in bulbar palsy) is retained for terms that
relate to the medulla oblongata, particularly in reference
to medical conditions. The word bulbar can refer to the
nerves and tracts connected to the medulla, and also by
association to those muscles innervated, such as those
of the tongue, pharynx and larynx.
The medulla can be thought of as being in two parts:

pyramid; (11) the anterior
median fissure; (15) is the
choroid plexus in the fourth
ventricle; (13) olive and (7) the
pons
an upper open part or superior part where the
dorsal surface of the medulla is formed by the
fourth ventricle.
a lower closed part or inferior part where the
fourth ventricle has narrowed at the obex in
the caudal medulla, and surrounds part of the
central canal.
The anterior median fissure contains a fold of pia mater,
and extends along the length of the medulla oblongata.
It ends at the lower border of the pons in a small
triangular area, termed the foramen cecum. On either
side of this fissure are raised areas termed the medullary
pyramids. The pyramids house the pyramidal tracts-the
corticospinal and the corticobulbar tracts of the nervous
system. At the caudal part of the medulla these tracts
cross over in the decussation of the pyramids obscuring the fissure at this
point. Some other fibers that originate from the anterior median fissure
above the decussation of the pyramids and run laterally across the
surface of the pons are known as the anterior external arcuate fibers.
The region between the anterolateral and posterolateral sulcus in the
upper part of the medulla is marked by a pair of swellings known as
olivary bodies (also called olives). They are caused by the largest nuclei
of the olivary bodies, the inferior olivary nuclei.
The posterior part of the medulla between the posterior median sulcus
and the posterolateral sulcus contains tracts that enter it from the
posterior funiculus of the spinal cord. These are the gracile fasciculus,
lying medially next to the midline, and the cuneate fasciculus, lying
laterally. These fasciculi end in rounded elevations known as the gracile
and the cuneate tubercles. They are caused by masses of gray matter
known as the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus. The soma (cell
bodies) in these nuclei are the second-order neurons of the posterior
column-medial lemniscus pathway, and their axons, called the internal
arcuate fibers or fasciculi, decussate from one side of the medulla to the
other to form the medial lemniscus.
Just above the tubercles, the posterior aspect of the medulla is occupied by a triangular fossa, which forms
the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The fossa is bounded on either side by the inferior
cerebellar peduncle, which connects the medulla to the cerebellum.
The lower part of the medulla, immediately lateral to the cuneate fasciculus, is marked by another
longitudinal elevation known as the tuberculum cinereum. It is caused by an underlying collection of gray
matter known as the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The gray matter of this nucleus is covered by a layer of

nerve fibers that form the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve. The base of the
medulla is defined by the commissural fibers, crossing over from the ipsilateral side
in the spinal cord to the contralateral side in the brain stem; below this is the spinal
cord.
Blood to the medulla is supplied by a number of arteries.[3]
Anterior spinal artery: This supplies the whole medial part of the
medulla oblongata.
Posterior inferior cerebellar artery: This is a major branch of the
vertebral artery, and supplies the posterolateral part of the medulla,
where the main sensory tracts run and synapse. It also supplies part of
the cerebellum.
Direct branches of the vertebral artery: The vertebral artery supplies an area between the
anterior spinal and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, including the solitary nucleus and
other sensory nuclei and fibers.
Posterior spinal artery: This supplies the dorsal column of the closed medulla containing
fasciculus gracilis, gracile nucleus, fasciculus cuneatus, and cuneate nucleus.
The medulla oblongata forms in fetal development from the myelencephalon. The final differentiation of the
medulla is seen at week 20 gestation.[4]
Neuroblasts from the alar plate of the neural tube at this level will produce the sensory nuclei of the
medulla. The basal plate neuroblasts will give rise to the motor nuclei.
Alar plate neuroblasts give rise to:
The solitary nucleus, which contains the general visceral afferent fibers for taste, as well
as the special visceral afferent column.
The spinal trigeminal nerve nuclei which contains the general somatic afferent column.
The cochlear and vestibular nuclei, which contain the special somatic afferent column.
The inferior olivary nucleus, which relays to the cerebellum.
The dorsal column nuclei, which contain the gracile and cuneate nuclei.
Basal plate neuroblasts give rise to:
The hypoglossal nucleus, which contains general somatic efferent fibers.
The nucleus ambiguus, which form the special visceral efferent.
The dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve and the inferior salivatory nucleus, both of which form
the general visceral efferent fibers.
The medulla oblongata connects the higher levels of the brain to the spinal cord, and is responsible for
several functions of the autonomous nervous system which include:
Blood supply
Development
Function
The control of ventilation via signals from the carotid and aortic bodies. Respiration is
regulated by groups of chemoreceptors. These sensors detect changes in the acidity of the
blood; if, for example, the blood becomes too acidic, the medulla oblongata sends electrical
signals to intercostal and phrenical muscle tissue to increase their contraction rate and
increase oxygenation of the blood. The ventral respiratory group and the dorsal respiratory
group are neurons involved in this regulation. The pre-Botzinger complex is a cluster of
interneurons involved in the respiratory function of the medulla.
Cardiovascular center - sympathetic, parasympathetic nervous system
Vasomotor center - baroreceptors
Reflex centers of vomiting, coughing, sneezing and swallowing. These reflexes which
include the pharyngeal reflex, the swallowing reflex (also known as the palatal reflex), and
the masseter reflex can be termed bulbar reflexes.[5]
A blood vessel blockage (such as in a stroke) will injure the pyramidal tract, medial lemniscus, and the
hypoglossal nucleus. This causes a syndrome called medial medullary syndrome.
Lateral medullary syndrome can be caused by the blockage of either the posterior inferior cerebellar artery
or of the vertebral arteries.
Progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) is a disease that attacks the nerves supplying the bulbar muscles. Infantile
progressive bulbar palsy is progressive bulbar palsy in children.
Clinical significance
Other animals
Both lampreys and hagfish possess a fully developed medulla oblongata.[6][7] Since these are both very
similar to early agnathans, it has been suggested that the medulla evolved in these early fish, approximately
505 million years ago.[8] The status of the medulla as part of the primordial reptilian brain is confirmed by
its disproportionate size in modern reptiles such as the crocodile, alligator, and monitor lizard.

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Motor nerve
A motor nerve, or efferent nerve, is a nerve that contains
exclusively efferent nerve fibers and transmits motor signals
from the central nervous system (CNS) to the muscles of the
body. This is different from the motor neuron, which includes a
cell body and branching of dendrites, while the nerve is made
up of a bundle of axons. Motor nerves act as efferent nerves
which carry information out from the CNS to muscles, as
opposed to afferent nerves (also called sensory nerves), which
transfer signals from sensory receptors in the periphery to the
CNS.[1] Efferent nerves can also connect to glands or other
organs/issues instead of muscles (and so motor nerves are not
equivalent to efferent nerves).[2][3] The vast majority of nerves
contain both sensory and motor fibers and are therefore called
mixed nerves.[4]
Motor nerve fibers transduce signals from the CNS to
peripheral neurons of proximal muscle tissue. Motor nerve axon
terminals innervate skeletal and smooth muscle, as they are
heavily involved in muscle control. Motor nerves tend to be
rich in acetylcholine vesicles because the motor nerve, a bundle
of motor nerve axons that deliver motor signals and signal for
movement and motor control.[5] Calcium vesicles reside in the
axon terminals of the motor nerve bundles. The high calcium
concentration outside of presynaptic motor nerves increases the
size of end-plate potentials (EPPs).[6]
Within motor nerves, each axon is wrapped by the
endoneurium, which is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the myelin sheath. Bundles of axons are
called fascicles, which are wrapped in perineurium. All of the fascicles wrapped in the perineurium are
wound together and wrapped by a final layer of connective tissue known as the epineurium. These
protective tissues defend nerves from injury, pathogens and help to maintain nerve function. Layers of
connective tissue maintain the rate at which nerves conduct action potentials.[7]
Structure and function
Protective tissues
Motor nerves wrapped in endoneurium
Most motor pathways originate in the motor cortex of the brain. Signals run down the brainstem and spinal
cord ipsilaterally, on the same side, and exit the spinal cord at the ventral horn of the spinal cord on either
side. Motor nerves communicate with the muscle cells they innervate through motor neurons once they exit
the spinal cord.[1][7]
Motor nerves can vary based on the subtype of motor neuron they are associate with.[8]
Alpha motor neurons target extrafusal muscle fibers. The motor nerves associated with these neurons
innervate extrafusal fibers and are responsible for muscle contraction. These nerve fibers have the largest
diameter of the motor neurons and require the highest conduction velocity of the three types.[8]
Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles. These nerves are responsible for signaling
slow twitch muscle fibers.[8]
Gamma motor neurons, unlike alpha motor neurons, are not directly involved in muscle contraction. The
nerves associated with these neurons do not send signals that directly adjust the shortening or lengthening of
muscle fibers. However, these nerves are important in keeping muscle spindles taut.[8]

Neurodegeneration
Neural stem cells seen in green
Motor neural degeneration is the progressive weakening of neural tissues and connections in the nervous
system. Muscles begin to weaken as there are no longer any motor nerves or pathways that allows for
muscle innervation. Motor neuron diseases can be viral, genetic or be a result of environmental factors. The
exact causes remain unclear, however many experts believe that toxic and environmental factors play a
large role.[9]
There are problems with neuroregeneration due to many sources,
both internal and external. There is a weak regenerative ability of
nerves and new nerve cells cannot simply be made. The outside
environment can also play a role in nerve regeneration. Neural stem
cells (NSCs), however, are able to differentiate into many different
types of nerve cells. This is one way that nerves can ""repair""
themselves. NSC transplant into damaged areas usually leads to the
cells differentiating into astrocytes which assists the surrounding
neurons. Schwann cells have the ability to regenerate, but the
capacity that these cells can repair nerve cells declines as time goes
on as well as distance the Schwann cells are from site of
damage.[10][11][12][13]

Myelin
Myelin (/'maI.@lIn/ MY-@-lin) is a lipid-rich material that surrounds
nerve cell axons (the nervous system's electrical wires) to insulate
them and increase the rate at which electrical impulses (called action
potentials) pass along the axon.[1][2] The myelinated axon can be
likened to an electrical wire (the axon) with insulating material
(myelin) around it. However, unlike the plastic covering on an
electrical wire, myelin does not form a single long sheath over the
entire length of the axon. Rather, myelin ensheaths the axon
segmentally: in general, each axon is encased in multiple long
sheaths with short gaps between, called nodes of Ranvier. At
the nodes of Ranvier, which are approximately one thousandth
of a mm in length, the axon's membrane is bare of myelin.
Myelin's best known function is to increase the rate at which
information, encoded as electrical charges, passes along the
axon's length. Myelin achieves this by eliciting saltatory
conduction,.[1] Saltatory conduction refers to the fact that
electrical impulses 'jump' along the axon, over long myelin
sheaths, from one node of Ranvier to the next. Thus,
information is passed around 100 times faster along a
myelinated axon than a non-myelinated one.
At the molecular level, the myelin sheath increases the distance
between extracellular and intracellular ions, reducing the
accumulation of electrical charges. The discontinuous structure
of the myelin sheath results in the action potential ""jumping""
from one node of Ranvier over a long (c. 0.1 mm - >1 mm, or
100-1000  micron) myelinated stretch of the axon called the
internodal segment or ""internode"", before ""recharging"" at the
next node of Ranvier. This 'jumping' continues until the action
potential reaches the axon terminal.[3][4][5] Once there, the
electrical 
signal 
provokes 
the 
release 
of 
chemical
neurotransmitters across the synapse, which bind to receptors
on the post-synaptic cell (e.g. another neuron, myocyte or
secretory cell).
Myelin is made by glial cells, which are non-neuronal cells that
provide nutritional and homeostatic support to the axons. This
is because axons, being elongated structures, are too far from
the soma to be supported by the neurons themselves. In the
central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerves),
myelination is formed by specialized glial cells called
2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fsig%2Fon
t%2Ffma%2Ffma62977)
Anatomical terminology
oligodendrocytes, each of which sends out processes (limb-like
extensions from the cell body) to myelinate multiple nearby
axons; while in the peripheral nervous system, myelin is formed
by neurolemmocytes (Schwann cells), which only myelinate a
section of one axon. In the CNS, axons carry electrical signals from one nerve cell body to another.[6][7]
The ""insulating"" function for myelin is essential for efficient motor function (i.e. movement such as
walking), sensory function (e.g. sight, hearing, smell, the feeling of touch or pain) and cognition (e.g.
acquiring and recalling knowledge), as demonstrated by the consequence of disorders that affect
myelination, such as the genetically determined leukodystrophies;[8] the acquired inflammatory
demyelinating 
disorder, 
multiple 
sclerosis;[9] 
and 
the 
inflammatory 
demyelinating 
peripheral
neuropathies.[10] Due to its high prevalence, multiple sclerosis, which specifically affects the central
nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerve), is the best known disorder of myelin.
The process of generating myelin is called myelination or myelinogenesis. In the CNS, oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells (OPCs) differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, which form myelin. In humans,
myelination begins early in the 3rd trimester,[11] although only little myelin is present in either the CNS or
the PNS at the time of birth. During infancy, myelination progresses rapidly, with increasing numbers of
axons acquiring myelin sheaths. This corresponds with the development of cognitive and motor skills,
including language comprehension, speech acquisition, crawling and walking. Myelination continues
through adolescence and early adulthood and although largely complete at this time, myelin sheaths can be
added in grey matter regions such as the cerebral cortex, throughout life.[12][13][14]
Myelin is considered a defining characteristic of the jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), though axons are
ensheathed by a type of cell, called glial cells, in invertebrates.[15][16] These glial wraps are quite different
from vertebrate compact myelin, formed, as indicated above, by concentric wrapping of the myelinating cell
process multiple times around the axon. Myelin was first described in 1854 by Rudolf Virchow,[17]
although it was over a century later, following the development of electron microscopy, that its glial cell
origin and its ultrastructure became apparent.[18]
In vertebrates, not all axons are myelinated. For example, in the PNS, a large proportion of axons are
unmyelinated. Instead, they are ensheathed by non-myelinating Schwann cells known as Remak SCs and
arranged in Remak bundles.[19] In the CNS, non-myelinated axons (or intermittently myelinated axons,
meaning axons with long non-myelinated regions between myelinated segments) intermingle with
myelinated ones and are entwined, at least partially, by the processes of another type of glial cell the
astrocyte.[20]
Functionally equivalent myelin-like sheaths are found in several invertebrate taxa, including oligochaete
annelids, and crustacean taxa such as penaeids, palaemonids, and calanoids. These myelin-like sheaths
share several structural features with the sheaths found in vertebrates including multiplicity of membranes,

condensation of membrane, and nodes.[15] However, the nodes in vertebrates are annular; i.e. they encircle
the axon. In contrast, nodes found in the sheaths of invertebrates are either annular or fenestrated; i.e. they
are restricted to ""spots"". The fastest recorded conduction speed (across both vertebrates and invertebrates) is
found in the ensheathed axons of the Kuruma shrimp, an invertebrate,[15] ranging between 90 and
200 m/s[16] (cf. 100-120 m/s for the fastest myelinated vertebrate axon).
CNS myelin differs slightly in composition and configuration from
PNS myelin, but both perform the same ""insulating"" function (see
above). Being rich in lipid, myelin appears white, hence the name
given to the ""white matter"" of the CNS. Both CNS white matter
tracts (e.g. the optic nerve, corticospinal tract and corpus callosum)
and PNS nerves (e.g. the sciatic nerve and the auditory nerve,
which also appear white) each comprise thousands to millions of
axons, largely aligned in parallel. Blood vessels provide the route
for oxygen and energy substrates such as glucose to reach these
fibre tracts, which also contain other cell types including astrocytes
and microglia in the CNS and macrophages in the PNS.
In terms of total mass, myelin comprises approximately 40% water;
the dry mass comprises between 60% and 75% lipid and between
15% and 25% protein. Protein content includes myelin basic protein
(MBP),[21] which is abundant in the CNS where it plays a critical,
non-redundant role in formation of compact myelin; myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG),[22] which is specific to the CNS; and
proteolipid protein (PLP),[23] which is the most abundant protein in CNS
myelin, but only a minor component of PNS myelin. In the PNS, myelin
protein zero (MPZ or P0) has a similar role to that of PLP in the CNS in
that it is involved in holding together the multiple concentric layers of glial
cell membrane that constitute the myelin sheath. The primary lipid of
myelin is a glycolipid called galactocerebroside. The intertwining
hydrocarbon chains of sphingomyelin strengthen the myelin sheath.
Cholesterol is an essential lipid component of myelin, without which myelin
fails to form.[24]
The main purpose of myelin is to increase the speed at which electrical
impulses (known as action potentials) propagate along the myelinated fiber.
In unmyelinated fibers, action potentials travel as continuous waves, but, in
myelinated fibers, they ""hop"" or propagate by saltatory conduction. The
latter is markedly faster than the former, at least for axons over a certain
diameter. Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance
across the axonal membrane (the axolemma). It has been suggested that
myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication
between distant body parts.[15]
Composition
Function
Action potential propagation in
myelinated neurons is faster than in
unmyelinated neurons because of
saltatory conduction.
Myelinated fibers lack voltage-gated sodium channels along the
myelinated internodes, exposing them only at the nodes of Ranvier.
Here, they are highly abundant and densely packed.[25] Positively
charged sodium ions can enter the axon through these voltage-gated
channels, leading to depolarisation of the membrane potential at the
node of Ranvier. The resting membrane potential is then rapidly
restored due to positively charged potassium ions leaving the axon
through potassium channels. The sodium ions inside the axon then
diffuse rapidly through the axoplasm (axonal cytoplasm), to the
adjacent myelinated internode and ultimately to the next (distal)
node of Ranvier, triggering the opening of the voltage gated sodium
channels and entry of sodium ions at this site. Although the sodium
ions diffuse through the axoplasm rapidly, diffusion is decremental
by nature, thus nodes of Ranvier have to be (relatively) closely
spaced, to secure action potential propagation.[26] The action
potential ""recharges"" at consecutive nodes of Ranvier as the
axolemmal membrane potential depolarises to approximately +35 mV.[25] Along the myelinated internode,
energy-dependent sodium/potassium pumps pump the sodium ions back out of the axon and potassium ions
back into the axon to restore the balance of ions between the intracellular (inside the cell, i.e. axon in this
case) and extracellular (outside the cell) fluids.
Whilst the role of myelin as an ""axonal insulator"" is well-established, other functions of myelinating cells
are less well known or only recently established. The myelinating cell ""sculpts"" the underlying axon by
promoting the phosphorylation of neurofilaments, thus increasing the diameter or thickness of the axon at
the internodal regions; helps cluster molecules on the axolemma (such as voltage-gated sodium channels) at
the node of Ranvier;[27] and modulates the transport of cytoskeletal structures and organelles such as
mitochondria, along the axon.[28] In 2012, evidence came to light to support a role for the myelinating cell
in ""feeding"" the axon.[29][30] In other words, the myelinating cell seems to act as a local ""fueling station""
for the axon, which uses a great deal of energy to restore the normal balance of ions between it and its
environment,[31][32] following the generation of action potentials.
When a peripheral fiber is severed, the myelin sheath provides a track along which regrowth can occur.
However, the myelin layer does not ensure a perfect regeneration of the nerve fiber. Some regenerated
nerve fibers do not find the correct muscle fibers, and some damaged motor neurons of the peripheral
nervous system die without regrowth. Damage to the myelin sheath and nerve fiber is often associated with
increased functional insufficiency.
Unmyelinated fibers and myelinated axons of the mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate.[33]
Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves, and is the hallmark of some
neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,
neuromyelitis optica, transverse myelitis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-
Barre syndrome, central pontine myelinosis, inherited demyelinating diseases such as leukodystrophy, and
Clinical significance
Demyelination
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. People with pernicious anaemia can also develop nerve damage if the
condition is not diagnosed quickly. Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord secondary to pernicious
anaemia can lead to slight peripheral nerve damage to severe damage to the central nervous system,
affecting speech, balance, and cognitive awareness. When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the
nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. A more serious case of myelin deterioration
is called Canavan disease.
The immune system may play a role in demyelination associated with such diseases, including inflammation
causing demyelination by overproduction of cytokines via upregulation of tumor necrosis factor[34] or
interferon. MRI evidence that docosahexaenoic acid DHA ethyl ester improves myelination in generalized
peroxisomal disorders.[35]
Demyelination results in diverse symptoms determined by the functions of the affected neurons. It disrupts
signals between the brain and other parts of the body; symptoms differ from patient to patient, and have
different presentations upon clinical observation and in laboratory studies.
Typical symptoms include blurriness in the central visual field that affects only one eye, may be
accompanied by pain upon eye movement, double vision, loss of vision/hearing, odd sensation in legs,
arms, chest, or face, such as tingling or numbness (neuropathy), weakness of arms or legs, cognitive
disruption, including speech impairment and memory loss, heat sensitivity (symptoms worsen or reappear
upon exposure to heat, such as a hot shower), loss of dexterity, difficulty coordinating movement or balance
disorder, difficulty controlling bowel movements or urination, fatigue, and tinnitus.[36]
Research to repair damaged myelin sheaths is ongoing. Techniques include surgically implanting
oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the central nervous system and inducing myelin repair with certain
antibodies. While results in mice have been encouraging (via stem cell transplantation), whether this
technique can be effective in replacing myelin loss in humans is still unknown.[37] Cholinergic treatments,
such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), may have beneficial effects on myelination, myelin repair,
and myelin integrity. Increasing cholinergic stimulation also may act through subtle trophic effects on brain
developmental processes and particularly on oligodendrocytes and the lifelong myelination process they
support. Increasing oligodendrocyte cholinergic stimulation, AChEIs, and other cholinergic treatments, such
as nicotine, possibly could promote myelination during development and myelin repair in older age.[38]
Glycogen synthase kinase 3b inhibitors such as lithium chloride have been found to promote myelination in
mice with damaged facial nerves.[39] Cholesterol is a necessary nutrient for the myelin sheath, along with
vitamin B12.[40][41]
Symptoms
Myelin repair
Dysmyelination
Dysmyelination is characterized by a defective structure and function of myelin sheaths; unlike
demyelination, it does not produce lesions. Such defective sheaths often arise from genetic mutations
affecting the biosynthesis and formation of myelin. The shiverer mouse represents one animal model of
dysmyelination. Human diseases where dysmyelination has been implicated include leukodystrophies
(Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Canavan disease, phenylketonuria) and schizophrenia.[42][43][44]

Anatomical terminology
Nervous system
In biology, the nervous system is the highly complex part of an
animal that coordinates its actions and sensory information by
transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. The
nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the
body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond
to such events.[1] Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike
organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago. In vertebrates, it
consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and
the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the
brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which
are enclosed bundles of the long fibers, or axons, that connect the
CNS to every other part of the body. Nerves that transmit signals
from the brain are called motor nerves (efferent), while those
nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are
called sensory nerves (afferent). The PNS is divided into two
separate subsystems, the somatic and autonomic, nervous
systems. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into
the sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems.
The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of
emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic
nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state.
The 
enteric 
nervous 
system 
functions 
to 
control 
the
gastrointestinal system. Nerves that exit from the brain are called
cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called
spinal nerves.
The nervous system consists of nervous tissue which, at a cellular
level, is defined by the presence of a special type of cell, called
the neuron. Neurons have special structures that allow them to
send signals rapidly and precisely to other cells. They send these
signals in the form of electrochemical impulses traveling along
thin fibers called axons, which can be directly transmitted to
neighboring cells through electrical synapses or cause chemicals
called neurotransmitters to be released at chemical synapses. A
cell that receives a synaptic signal from a neuron may be excited,
inhibited, or otherwise modulated. The connections between neurons can form neural pathways, neural
circuits, and larger networks that generate an organism's perception of the world and determine its behavior.
Along with neurons, the nervous system contains other specialized cells called glial cells (or simply glia),
which provide structural and metabolic support. Many of the cells and vasculature channels within the
nervous system make up the neurovascular unit, which regulates cerebral blood flow in order to rapidly
satisfy the high energy demands of activated neurons.[2]
Nervous systems are found in most multicellular animals, but vary greatly in complexity.[3] The only
multicellular animals that have no nervous system at all are sponges, placozoans, and mesozoans, which have
very simple body plans. The nervous systems of the radially symmetric organisms ctenophores (comb jellies)
and cnidarians (which include anemones, hydras, corals and jellyfish) consist of a diffuse nerve net. All other
animal species, with the exception of a few types of worm, have a nervous system containing a brain, a
central cord (or two cords running in parallel), and nerves radiating from the brain and central cord. The size
of the nervous system ranges from a few hundred cells in the simplest worms, to around 300 billion cells in
African elephants.[4]
The central nervous system functions to send signals from one cell to others, or from one part of the body to
others and to receive feedback. Malfunction of the nervous system can occur as a result of genetic defects,
physical damage due to trauma or toxicity, infection, or simply senescence. The medical specialty of
neurology studies disorders of the nervous system and looks for interventions that can prevent or treat them.
In the peripheral nervous system, the most common problem is the failure of nerve conduction, which can be
due to different causes including diabetic neuropathy and demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuroscience is the field of science that focuses on the study of the nervous
system.
The nervous system derives its name from nerves, which are cylindrical bundles of fibers (the axons of
neurons), that emanate from the brain and spinal cord, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the
body.[5] Nerves are large enough to have been recognized by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans,[6]
but their internal structure was not understood until it became possible to examine them using a microscope.[7]
The author Michael Nikoletseas wrote:[8]
""It is difficult to believe that until approximately year 1900 it was not known that neurons are the
basic units of the brain (Santiago Ramon y Cajal). Equally surprising is the fact that the concept
of chemical transmission in the brain was not known until around 1930 (Henry Hallett Dale and
Otto Loewi). We began to understand the basic electrical phenomenon that neurons use in order
to communicate among themselves, the action potential, in the 1950s (Alan Lloyd Hodgkin,
Andrew Huxley and John Eccles). It was in the 1960s that we became aware of how basic
neuronal networks code stimuli and thus basic concepts are possible (David H. Hubel and
Torsten Wiesel). The molecular revolution swept across US universities in the 1980s. It was in
the 1990s that molecular mechanisms of behavioral phenomena became widely known (Eric
Richard Kandel).""
A microscopic examination shows that nerves consist primarily of axons, along with different membranes that
wrap around them and segregate them into fascicles. The neurons that give rise to nerves do not lie entirely
within the nerves themselves--their cell bodies reside within the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral ganglia.[5]
All animals more advanced than sponges have nervous systems. However, even sponges, unicellular animals,
and non-animals such as slime molds have cell-to-cell signalling mechanisms that are precursors to those of
neurons.[9] In radially symmetric animals such as the jellyfish and hydra, the nervous system consists of a

nerve net, a diffuse network of isolated cells.[10] In bilaterian animals, which make up the great majority of
existing species, the nervous system has a common structure that originated early in the Ediacaran period,
over 550 million years ago.[11][12]
The nervous system contains two main categories or types of cells: neurons and glial cells.
The nervous system is defined by the
presence of a special type of cell--the
neuron (sometimes called ""neurone"" or
""nerve 
cell"").[5] 
Neurons 
can 
be
distinguished from other cells in a
number 
of 
ways, 
but 
their 
most
fundamental 
property 
is 
that 
they
communicate 
with 
other 
cells 
via
synapses, 
which 
are 
membrane-to-
membrane 
junctions 
containing
molecular machinery that allows rapid
transmission of signals, either electrical
or chemical.[5] Many types of neuron
possess an axon, a protoplasmic protrusion that can extend to distant parts of the body and make thousands of
synaptic contacts;[13] axons typically extend throughout the body in bundles called nerves.
Even in the nervous system of a single species such as humans, hundreds of different types of neurons exist,
with a wide variety of morphologies and functions.[13] These include sensory neurons that transmute physical
stimuli such as light and sound into neural signals, and motor neurons that transmute neural signals into
activation of muscles or glands; however in many species the great majority of neurons participate in the
formation of centralized structures (the brain and ganglia) and they receive all of their input from other
neurons and send their output to other neurons.[5]
Glial cells (named from the Greek for ""glue"") are non-neuronal cells that provide support and nutrition,
maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and participate in signal transmission in the nervous system.[14] In the
human brain, it is estimated that the total number of glia roughly equals the number of neurons, although the
proportions vary in different brain areas.[15] Among the most important functions of glial cells are to support
neurons and hold them in place; to supply nutrients to neurons; to insulate neurons electrically; to destroy
pathogens and remove dead neurons; and to provide guidance cues directing the axons of neurons to their
targets.[14] A very important type of glial cell (oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, and Schwann
cells in the peripheral nervous system) generates layers of a fatty substance called myelin that wraps around

axons and provides electrical insulation which allows them to transmit action potentials much more rapidly
and efficiently. Recent findings indicate that glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, serve as important
resident immune cells within the central nervous system.
The 
nervous 
system 
of 
vertebrates
(including humans) is divided into the
central nervous system (CNS) and the
peripheral nervous system (PNS).[16]
The (CNS) is the major division, and
consists of the brain and the spinal cord.[16]
The spinal canal contains the spinal cord,
while the cranial cavity contains the brain.
The CNS is enclosed and protected by the
meninges, 
a 
three-layered 
system 
of
membranes, including a tough, leathery
outer layer called the dura mater. The brain
is also protected by the skull, and the spinal
cord by the vertebrae.
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is a
collective term for the nervous system
structures that do not lie within the CNS.[17]
The large majority of the axon bundles called nerves are considered
to belong to the PNS, even when the cell bodies of the neurons to
which they belong reside within the brain or spinal cord. The PNS is
divided into somatic and visceral parts. The somatic part consists of
the nerves that innervate the skin, joints, and muscles. The cell bodies
of somatic sensory neurons lie in dorsal root ganglia of the spinal
cord. The visceral part, also known as the autonomic nervous system,
contains neurons that innervate the internal organs, blood vessels, and
glands. The autonomic nervous system itself consists of two parts: the
sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.
Some authors also include sensory neurons whose cell bodies lie in
the periphery (for senses such as hearing) as part of the PNS; others,
however, omit them.[18]
The vertebrate nervous system can also be divided into areas called
gray matter and white matter.[19] Gray matter (which is only gray in
preserved tissue, and is better described as pink or light brown in
living tissue) contains a high proportion of cell bodies of neurons.
White matter is composed mainly of myelinated axons, and takes its
color from the myelin. White matter includes all of the nerves, and much of the interior of the brain and spinal
cord. Gray matter is found in clusters of neurons in the brain and spinal cord, and in cortical layers that line
Anatomy in vertebrates
Nervous system of a bilaterian
animal, in the form of a nerve cord
with segmental enlargements, and a

their surfaces. There is an anatomical convention that a cluster of neurons in the brain or spinal cord is called
a nucleus, whereas a cluster of neurons in the periphery is called a ganglion.[20] There are, however, a few
exceptions to this rule, notably including the part of the forebrain called the basal ganglia.[21]
Sponges have no cells connected to each other by synaptic junctions, that is, no neurons, and therefore no
nervous system. They do, however, have homologs of many genes that play key roles in synaptic function.
Recent studies have shown that sponge cells express a group of proteins that cluster together to form a
structure resembling a postsynaptic density (the signal-receiving part of a synapse).[9] However, the function
of this structure is currently unclear. Although sponge cells do not show synaptic transmission, they do
communicate with each other via calcium waves and other impulses, which mediate some simple actions such
as whole-body contraction.[22]
Jellyfish, comb jellies, and related animals have diffuse nerve nets rather than a central nervous system. In
most jellyfish the nerve net is spread more or less evenly across the body; in comb jellies it is concentrated
near the mouth. The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons, which pick up chemical, tactile, and visual signals;
motor neurons, which can activate contractions of the body wall; and intermediate neurons, which detect
patterns of activity in the sensory neurons and, in response, send signals to groups of motor neurons. In some
cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia.[10]
The development of the nervous system in radiata is relatively unstructured. Unlike bilaterians, radiata only
have two primordial cell layers, endoderm and ectoderm. Neurons are generated from a special set of
ectodermal precursor cells, which also serve as precursors for every other ectodermal cell type.[23]
The vast majority of existing animals are bilaterians, meaning animals
with left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each
other. All bilateria are thought to have descended from a common
wormlike ancestor that appear as fossils beginning in the Ediacaran
period, 550-600 million years ago.[11] The fundamental bilaterian
body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from mouth to
anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ""ganglion"") for each
body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called
the ""brain"".
Even mammals, including humans, show the segmented bilaterian body plan at the level of the nervous
system. The spinal cord contains a series of segmental ganglia, each giving rise to motor and sensory nerves
that innervate a portion of the body surface and underlying musculature. On the limbs, the layout of the
innervation pattern is complex, but on the trunk it gives rise to a series of narrow bands. The top three
segments belong to the brain, giving rise to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.[24]

Bilaterians can be divided, based on events that occur very early in embryonic
development, 
into 
two 
groups 
(superphyla) 
called 
protostomes 
and
deuterostomes.[25] Deuterostomes include vertebrates as well as echinoderms,
hemichordates (mainly acorn worms), and Xenoturbellidans.[26] Protostomes, the
more diverse group, include arthropods, molluscs, and numerous phyla of ""worms"".
There is a basic difference between the two groups in the placement of the nervous
system within the body: protostomes possess a nerve cord on the ventral (usually
bottom) side of the body, whereas in deuterostomes the nerve cord is on the dorsal
(usually top) side. In fact, numerous aspects of the body are inverted between the
two groups, including the expression patterns of several genes that show dorsal-to-
ventral gradients. Most anatomists now consider that the bodies of protostomes and
deuterostomes are ""flipped over"" with respect to each other, a hypothesis that was
first proposed by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire for insects in comparison to vertebrates.
Thus insects, for example, have nerve cords that run along the ventral midline of the
body, while all vertebrates have spinal cords that run along the dorsal midline.[27]
Worms are the simplest bilaterian animals, and reveal the basic
structure of the bilaterian nervous system in the most
straightforward way. As an example, earthworms have dual
nerve cords running along the length of the body and merging at
the tail and the mouth. These nerve cords are connected by
transverse nerves like the rungs of a ladder. These transverse
nerves help coordinate the two sides of the animal. Two ganglia
at the head (the ""nerve ring"") end function similar to a simple
brain. Photoreceptors on the animal's eyespots provide sensory
information on light and dark.[28]
The nervous system of one very small roundworm, the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, has been completely mapped out in a
connectome including its synapses. Every neuron and its cellular
lineage has been recorded and most, if not all, of the neural connections are known. In this species, the
nervous system is sexually dimorphic; the nervous systems of the two sexes, males and female
hermaphrodites, have different numbers of neurons and groups of neurons that perform sex-specific functions.
In C. elegans, males have exactly 383 neurons, while hermaphrodites have exactly 302 neurons.[29]
Arthropods, such as insects and crustaceans, have a nervous
system made up of a series of ganglia, connected by a ventral
nerve cord made up of two parallel connectives running along
the length of the belly.[30] Typically, each body segment has one
ganglion on each side, though some ganglia are fused to form the
brain and other large ganglia. The head segment contains the
brain, also known as the supraesophageal ganglion. In the insect
nervous system, the brain is anatomically divided into the
protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebrum. Immediately
Worms
Arthropods
Simplified diagram of the mollusc
nervous system
behind the brain is the subesophageal ganglion, which is composed of three pairs of fused ganglia. It controls
the mouthparts, the salivary glands and certain muscles. Many arthropods have well-developed sensory
organs, including compound eyes for vision and antennae for olfaction and pheromone sensation. The
sensory information from these organs is processed by the brain.
In insects, many neurons have cell bodies that are positioned at the edge of the brain and are electrically
passive--the cell bodies serve only to provide metabolic support and do not participate in signalling. A
protoplasmic fiber runs from the cell body and branches profusely, with some parts transmitting signals and
other parts receiving signals. Thus, most parts of the insect brain have passive cell bodies arranged around the
periphery, while the neural signal processing takes place in a tangle of protoplasmic fibers called neuropil, in
the interior.[31]
The cephalic molluscs have two pairs of main nerve cords organized
around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the
internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of
corresponding ganglia on both sides of the body are linked by
commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above
the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are
located above the esophagus (gullet). The pedal ganglia, which
control the foot, are below the esophagus and their commissure and
connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround the
esophagus in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.[33]
The acephalic molluscs (i.e., bivalves) also have this ring but it is less
obvious and less important. The bivalves have only three pairs of
ganglia-- cerebral, pedal, and visceral-- with the visceral as the
largest and most important of the three functioning as the principal
center of ""thinking"".[34][35] Some such as the scallops have eyes
around the edges of their shells which connect to a pair of looped
nerves and which provide the ability to distinguish between light and
shadow.
A neuron is called identified if it has properties that distinguish it from every other neuron in the same animal
--properties such as location, neurotransmitter, gene expression pattern, and connectivity--and if every
individual organism belonging to the same species has one and only one neuron with the same set of
properties.[36] In vertebrate nervous systems very few neurons are ""identified"" in this sense--in humans,
there are believed to be none--but in simpler nervous systems, some or all neurons may be thus unique. In
the roundworm C. elegans, whose nervous system is the most thoroughly described of any animal's, every
neuron in the body is uniquely identifiable, with the same location and the same connections in every
individual worm. One notable consequence of this fact is that the form of the C. elegans nervous system is
completely specified by the genome, with no experience-dependent plasticity.[29]
The brains of many molluscs and insects also contain substantial numbers of identified neurons.[36] In
vertebrates, the best known identified neurons are the gigantic Mauthner cells of fish.[37] Every fish has two
Mauthner cells, in the bottom part of the brainstem, one on the left side and one on the right. Each Mauthner
cell has an axon that crosses over, innervating neurons at the same brain level and then travelling down
Molluscs
""Identified"" neurons
through the spinal cord, making numerous connections as it goes. The synapses generated by a Mauthner cell
are so powerful that a single action potential gives rise to a major behavioral response: within milliseconds the
fish curves its body into a C-shape, then straightens, thereby propelling itself rapidly forward. Functionally
this is a fast escape response, triggered most easily by a strong sound wave or pressure wave impinging on
the lateral line organ of the fish. Mauthner cells are not the only identified neurons in fish--there are about 20
more types, including pairs of ""Mauthner cell analogs"" in each spinal segmental nucleus. Although a
Mauthner cell is capable of bringing about an escape response individually, in the context of ordinary
behavior other types of cells usually contribute to shaping the amplitude and direction of the response.
Mauthner cells have been described as command neurons. A command neuron is a special type of identified
neuron, defined as a neuron that is capable of driving a specific behavior individually.[38] Such neurons
appear most commonly in the fast escape systems of various species--the squid giant axon and squid giant
synapse, used for pioneering experiments in neurophysiology because of their enormous size, both participate
in the fast escape circuit of the squid. The concept of a command neuron has, however, become controversial,
because of studies showing that some neurons that initially appeared to fit the description were really only
capable of evoking a response in a limited set of circumstances.[39]
At the most basic level, the function of the nervous system is to send signals from one cell to others, or from
one part of the body to others. There are multiple ways that a cell can send signals to other cells. One is by
releasing chemicals called hormones into the internal circulation, so that they can diffuse to distant sites. In
contrast to this ""broadcast"" mode of signaling, the nervous system provides ""point-to-point"" signals--neurons
project their axons to specific target areas and make synaptic connections with specific target cells.[40] Thus,
neural signaling is capable of a much higher level of specificity than hormonal signaling. It is also much
faster: the fastest nerve signals travel at speeds that exceed 100 meters per second.
At a more integrative level, the primary function of the nervous system is to control the body.[5] It does this by
extracting information from the environment using sensory receptors, sending signals that encode this
information into the central nervous system, processing the information to determine an appropriate response,
and sending output signals to muscles or glands to activate the response. The evolution of a complex nervous
system has made it possible for various animal species to have advanced perception abilities such as vision,
complex social interactions, rapid coordination of organ systems, and integrated processing of concurrent
signals. In humans, the sophistication of the nervous system makes it possible to have language, abstract
representation of concepts, transmission of culture, and many other features of human society that would not
exist without the human brain.
Most neurons send signals via their axons, although some types are capable of dendrite-to-dendrite
communication. (In fact, the types of neurons called amacrine cells have no axons, and communicate only via
their dendrites.) Neural signals propagate along an axon in the form of electrochemical waves called action
potentials, which produce cell-to-cell signals at points where axon terminals make synaptic contact with other
cells.[41]
Synapses may be electrical or chemical. Electrical synapses make direct electrical connections between
neurons,[42] but chemical synapses are much more common, and much more diverse in function.[43] At a
chemical synapse, the cell that sends signals is called presynaptic, and the cell that receives signals is called
Function
Neurons and synapses
Major elements in synaptic transmission. An
electrochemical wave called an action potential travels
along the axon of a neuron. When the wave reaches a
synapse, it provokes release of a small amount of
neurotransmitter molecules, which bind to chemical
receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.

postsynaptic. 
Both 
the 
presynaptic 
and
postsynaptic 
areas 
are 
full 
of 
molecular
machinery that carries out the signalling process.
The presynaptic area contains large numbers of
tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles,
packed with neurotransmitter chemicals.[41]
When the presynaptic terminal is electrically
stimulated, an array of molecules embedded in
the membrane are activated, and cause the
contents of the vesicles to be released into the
narrow space between the presynaptic and
postsynaptic membranes, called the synaptic
cleft. The neurotransmitter then binds to
receptors 
embedded 
in 
the 
postsynaptic
membrane, causing them to enter an activated
state.[43] Depending on the type of receptor, the
resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be
excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory in more
complex ways. For example, release of the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic
contact between a motor neuron and a muscle
cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle
cell.[44] The entire synaptic transmission process
takes only a fraction of a millisecond, although
the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much
longer (even indefinitely, in cases where the
synaptic signal leads to the formation of a
memory trace).[13]
There are literally hundreds of different
types of synapses. In fact, there are over
a hundred known neurotransmitters, and
many of them have multiple types of
receptors.[45] Many synapses use more
than one neurotransmitter--a common
arrangement is for a synapse to use one
fast-acting 
small-molecule
neurotransmitter such as glutamate or
GABA, along with one or more peptide
neurotransmitters that play slower-acting
modulatory 
roles. 
Molecular
neuroscientists generally divide receptors
into two broad groups: chemically gated ion channels and second messenger systems. When a chemically
gated ion channel is activated, it forms a passage that allows specific types of ions to flow across the
membrane. Depending on the type of ion, the effect on the target cell may be excitatory or inhibitory. When a
second messenger system is activated, it starts a cascade of molecular interactions inside the target cell, which
may ultimately produce a wide variety of complex effects, such as increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of
the cell to stimuli, or even altering gene transcription.

According to a rule called Dale's principle, which has only a few known exceptions, a neuron releases the
same neurotransmitters at all of its synapses.[46] This does not mean, though, that a neuron exerts the same
effect on all of its targets, because the effect of a synapse depends not on the neurotransmitter, but on the
receptors that it activates.[43] Because different targets can (and frequently do) use different types of receptors,
it is possible for a neuron to have excitatory effects on one set of target cells, inhibitory effects on others, and
complex modulatory effects on others still. Nevertheless, it happens that the two most widely used
neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, each have largely consistent effects. Glutamate has several widely
occurring types of receptors, but all of them are excitatory or modulatory. Similarly, GABA has several
widely occurring receptor types, but all of them are inhibitory.[47] Because of this consistency, glutamatergic
cells are frequently referred to as ""excitatory neurons"", and GABAergic cells as ""inhibitory neurons"". Strictly
speaking, this is an abuse of terminology--it is the receptors that are excitatory and inhibitory, not the neurons
--but it is commonly seen even in scholarly publications.
One very important subset of synapses are capable of forming memory traces by means of long-lasting
activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength.[48] The best-known form of neural memory is a process
called long-term potentiation (abbreviated LTP), which operates at synapses that use the neurotransmitter
glutamate acting on a special type of receptor known as the NMDA receptor.[49] The NMDA receptor has an
""associative"" property: if the two cells involved in the synapse are both activated at approximately the same
time, a channel opens that permits calcium to flow into the target cell.[50] The calcium entry initiates a second
messenger cascade that ultimately leads to an increase in the number of glutamate receptors in the target cell,
thereby increasing the effective strength of the synapse. This change in strength can last for weeks or longer.
Since the discovery of LTP in 1973, many other types of synaptic memory traces have been found, involving
increases or decreases in synaptic strength that are induced by varying conditions, and last for variable periods
of time.[49] The reward system, that reinforces desired behaviour for example, depends on a variant form of
LTP that is conditioned on an extra input coming from a reward-signalling pathway that uses dopamine as
neurotransmitter.[51] All these forms of synaptic modifiability, taken collectively, give rise to neural plasticity,
that is, to a capability for the nervous system to adapt itself to variations in the environment.
The basic neuronal function of sending signals to other cells includes a capability for neurons to exchange
signals with each other. Networks formed by interconnected groups of neurons are capable of a wide variety
of functions, including feature detection, pattern generation and timing,[52] and there are seen to be countless
types of information processing possible. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts showed in 1943 that even
artificial neural networks formed from a greatly simplified mathematical abstraction of a neuron are capable of
universal computation.[53]
Historically, for many years the predominant view of the function of the nervous system was as a stimulus-
response associator.[54] In this conception, neural processing begins with stimuli that activate sensory
neurons, producing signals that propagate through chains of connections in the spinal cord and brain, giving
rise eventually to activation of motor neurons and thereby to muscle contraction, i.e., to overt responses.
Descartes believed that all of the behaviors of animals, and most of the behaviors of humans, could be
explained in terms of stimulus-response circuits, although he also believed that higher cognitive functions
such as language were not capable of being explained mechanistically.[55] Charles Sherrington, in his
influential 1906 book The Integrative Action of the Nervous System,[54] developed the concept of stimulus-
response mechanisms in much more detail, and Behaviorism, the school of thought that dominated
Psychology through the middle of the 20th century, attempted to explain every aspect of human behavior in
stimulus-response terms.[56]
Neural circuits and systems
Illustration of pain pathway, from
Rene Descartes's Treatise of Man
Simplified schema of basic nervous system function: signals are
picked up by sensory receptors and sent to the spinal cord and
brain, where processing occurs that results in signals sent back to
the spinal cord and then out to motor neurons
However, experimental studies of electrophysiology, beginning in the
early 20th century and reaching high productivity by the 1940s,
showed that the nervous system contains many mechanisms for
maintaining cell excitability and generating patterns of activity
intrinsically, without requiring an external stimulus.[57] Neurons were
found to be capable of producing regular sequences of action
potentials, or sequences of bursts, even in complete isolation.[58]
When intrinsically active neurons are connected to each other in
complex circuits, the possibilities for generating intricate temporal
patterns become far more extensive.[52] A modern conception views
the function of the nervous system partly in terms of stimulus-
response chains, and partly in terms of intrinsically generated activity
patterns--both types of activity interact with each other to generate
the full repertoire of behavior.[59]
The simplest type of neural circuit is a
reflex arc, which begins with a sensory
input and ends with a motor output,
passing through a sequence of neurons
connected in series.[60] This can be
shown in the ""withdrawal reflex""
causing a hand to jerk back after a hot
stove is touched. The circuit begins with
sensory receptors in the skin that are
activated by harmful levels of heat: a
special type of molecular structure
embedded in the membrane causes heat
to change the electrical field across the
membrane. If the change in electrical
potential is large enough to pass the
given threshold, it evokes an action
potential, which is transmitted along the
axon of the receptor cell, into the spinal
cord. There the axon makes excitatory
synaptic contacts with other cells, some
of which project (send axonal output) to
the same region of the spinal cord, others projecting into the brain. One target is a set of spinal interneurons
that project to motor neurons controlling the arm muscles. The interneurons excite the motor neurons, and if
the excitation is strong enough, some of the motor neurons generate action potentials, which travel down their
axons to the point where they make excitatory synaptic contacts with muscle cells. The excitatory signals
induce contraction of the muscle cells, which causes the joint angles in the arm to change, pulling the arm
away.
In reality, this straightforward schema is subject to numerous complications.[60] Although for the simplest
reflexes there are short neural paths from sensory neuron to motor neuron, there are also other nearby neurons
that participate in the circuit and modulate the response. Furthermore, there are projections from the brain to
Reflexes and other stimulus-response circuits
the spinal cord that are capable of enhancing or inhibiting the reflex.
Although the simplest reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more
complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain.[61] For example, when an object in the periphery of
the visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. The initial
sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain
stem, are not all that different from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely
different. Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen
stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum,
and several brainstem nuclei. These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection,
perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.[62]
Feature detection is the ability to extract biologically relevant information from combinations of sensory
signals.[63] In the visual system, for example, sensory receptors in the retina of the eye are only individually
capable of detecting ""points of light"" in the outside world.[64] Second-level visual neurons receive input from
groups of primary receptors, higher-level neurons receive input from groups of second-level neurons, and so
on, forming a hierarchy of processing stages. At each stage, important information is extracted from the signal
ensemble and unimportant information is discarded. By the end of the process, input signals representing
""points of light"" have been transformed into a neural representation of objects in the surrounding world and
their properties. The most sophisticated sensory processing occurs inside the brain, but complex feature
extraction also takes place in the spinal cord and in peripheral sensory organs such as the retina.
Although stimulus-response mechanisms are the easiest to understand, the nervous system is also capable of
controlling the body in ways that do not require an external stimulus, by means of internally generated
rhythms of activity. Because of the variety of voltage-sensitive ion channels that can be embedded in the
membrane of a neuron, many types of neurons are capable, even in isolation, of generating rhythmic
sequences of action potentials, or rhythmic alternations between high-rate bursting and quiescence. When
neurons that are intrinsically rhythmic are connected to each other by excitatory or inhibitory synapses, the
resulting networks are capable of a wide variety of dynamical behaviors, including attractor dynamics,
periodicity, and even chaos. A network of neurons that uses its internal structure to generate temporally
structured output, without requiring a corresponding temporally structured stimulus, is called a central pattern
generator.
Internal pattern generation operates on a wide range of time scales, from milliseconds to hours or longer. One
of the most important types of temporal pattern is circadian rhythmicity--that is, rhythmicity with a period of
approximately 24 hours. All animals that have been studied show circadian fluctuations in neural activity,
which control circadian alternations in behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental studies dating
from the 1990s have shown that circadian rhythms are generated by a ""genetic clock"" consisting of a special
set of genes whose expression level rises and falls over the course of the day. Animals as diverse as insects
and vertebrates share a similar genetic clock system. The circadian clock is influenced by light but continues
to operate even when light levels are held constant and no other external time-of-day cues are available. The
clock genes are expressed in many parts of the nervous system as well as many peripheral organs, but in
mammals, all of these ""tissue clocks"" are kept in synchrony by signals that emanate from a master timekeeper
in a tiny part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
Intrinsic pattern generation
Mirror neurons
A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same
action performed by another.[65][66][67] Thus, the neuron ""mirrors"" the behavior of the other, as though the
observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate species.[68] Birds have been
shown to have imitative resonance behaviors and neurological evidence suggests the presence of some form
of mirroring system.[68][69] In humans, brain activity consistent with that of mirror neurons has been found in
the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the primary somatosensory cortex and the inferior parietal
cortex.[70] The function of the mirror system is a subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive
neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for
the perception/action coupling (see the common coding theory).[67] They argue that mirror neurons may be
important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some
researchers also speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to theory of
mind skills,[71][72] while others relate mirror neurons to language abilities.[73] However, to date, no widely
accepted neural or computational models have been put forward to describe how mirror neuron activity
supports cognitive functions such as imitation.[74] There are neuroscientists who caution that the claims being
made for the role of mirror neurons are not supported by adequate research.[75][76]
In vertebrates, landmarks of embryonic neural development include the birth and differentiation of neurons
from stem cell precursors, the migration of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their
final positions, outgrowth of axons from neurons and guidance of the motile growth cone through the embryo
towards postsynaptic partners, the generation of synapses between these axons and their postsynaptic
partners, and finally the lifelong changes in synapses which are thought to underlie learning and memory.[77]
All bilaterian animals at an early stage of development form a gastrula, which is polarized, with one end
called the animal pole and the other the vegetal pole. The gastrula has the shape of a disk with three layers of
cells, an inner layer called the endoderm, which gives rise to the lining of most internal organs, a middle layer
called the mesoderm, which gives rise to the bones and muscles, and an outer layer called the ectoderm,
which gives rise to the skin and nervous system.[78]
Human embryo, showing neural groove
Four stages in the development of the neural tube in the human embryo
In vertebrates, the first sign of the nervous system is the appearance of a thin strip of cells along the center of
the back, called the neural plate. The inner portion of the neural plate (along the midline) is destined to
become the central nervous system (CNS), the outer portion the peripheral nervous system (PNS). As
Development
Layers protecting the brain and spinal cord
development proceeds, a fold called the neural groove appears along the midline. This fold deepens, and then
closes up at the top. At this point the future CNS appears as a cylindrical structure called the neural tube,
whereas the future PNS appears as two strips of tissue called the neural crest, running lengthwise above the
neural tube. The sequence of stages from neural plate to neural tube and neural crest is known as neurulation.
In the early 20th century, a set of famous experiments by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold showed that the
formation of nervous tissue is ""induced"" by signals from a group of mesodermal cells called the organizer
region.[77] For decades, though, the nature of neural induction defeated every attempt to figure it out, until
finally it was resolved by genetic approaches in the 1990s. Induction of neural tissue requires inhibition of the
gene for a so-called bone morphogenetic protein, or BMP. Specifically the protein BMP4 appears to be
involved. Two proteins called Noggin and Chordin, both secreted by the mesoderm, are capable of inhibiting
BMP4 and thereby inducing ectoderm to turn into neural tissue. It appears that a similar molecular mechanism
is involved for widely disparate types of animals, including arthropods as well as vertebrates. In some
animals, however, another type of molecule called Fibroblast Growth Factor or FGF may also play an
important role in induction.
Induction of neural tissues causes formation of neural precursor cells, called neuroblasts.[79] In drosophila,
neuroblasts divide asymmetrically, so that one product is a ""ganglion mother cell"" (GMC), and the other is a
neuroblast. A GMC divides once, to give rise to either a pair of neurons or a pair of glial cells. In all, a
neuroblast is capable of generating an indefinite number of neurons or glia.
As shown in a 2008 study, one factor common to all bilateral organisms (including humans) is a family of
secreted signaling molecules called neurotrophins which regulate the growth and survival of neurons.[80] Zhu
et al. identified DNT1, the first neurotrophin found in flies. DNT1 shares structural similarity with all known
neurotrophins and is a key factor in the fate of neurons in Drosophila. Because neurotrophins have now been
identified in both vertebrate and invertebrates, this evidence suggests that neurotrophins were present in an
ancestor common to bilateral organisms and may represent a common mechanism for nervous system
formation.
The central nervous system is protected by major physical and
chemical barriers. Physically, the brain and spinal cord are
surrounded by tough meningeal membranes, and enclosed in
the bones of the skull and vertebral column, which combine to
form a strong physical shield. Chemically, the brain and spinal
cord are isolated by the blood-brain barrier, which prevents
most types of chemicals from moving from the bloodstream
into the interior of the CNS. These protections make the CNS
less susceptible in many ways than the PNS; the flip side,
however, is that damage to the CNS tends to have more
serious consequences.
Although nerves tend to lie deep under the skin except in a few places such as the ulnar nerve near the elbow
joint, they are still relatively exposed to physical damage, which can cause pain, loss of sensation, or loss of
muscle control. Damage to nerves can also be caused by swelling or bruises at places where a nerve passes
through a tight bony channel, as happens in carpal tunnel syndrome. If a nerve is completely transected, it will
often regenerate, but for long nerves this process may take months to complete. In addition to physical
damage, peripheral neuropathy may be caused by many other medical problems, including genetic conditions,
Pathology
metabolic conditions such as diabetes, inflammatory conditions such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, vitamin
deficiency, infectious diseases such as leprosy or shingles, or poisoning by toxins such as heavy metals. Many
cases have no cause that can be identified, and are referred to as idiopathic. It is also possible for nerves to
lose function temporarily, resulting in numbness as stiffness--common causes include mechanical pressure, a
drop in temperature, or chemical interactions with local anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine.
Physical damage to the spinal cord may result in loss of sensation or movement. If an injury to the spine
produces nothing worse than swelling, the symptoms may be transient, but if nerve fibers in the spine are
actually destroyed, the loss of function is usually permanent. Experimental studies have shown that spinal
nerve fibers attempt to regrow in the same way as nerve fibers, but in the spinal cord, tissue destruction
usually produces scar tissue that cannot be penetrated by the regrowing nerves.

Neural circuit
A neural circuit is a population of neurons
interconnected by synapses to carry out a specific
function when activated.[1] Multiple neural circuits
interconnect with one another to form large scale brain
networks.[2]
Neural circuits have inspired the design of artificial
neural 
networks, 
though 
there 
are 
significant
differences.
Early treatments of neural networks can be found in
Herbert Spencer's Principles of Psychology, 3rd
edition (1872), Theodor Meynert's Psychiatry (1884),
William James' Principles of Psychology (1890), and
Sigmund Freud's Project for a Scientific Psychology
(composed 1895).[3] The first rule of neuronal learning
was described by Hebb in 1949, in the Hebbian theory.
Thus, Hebbian pairing of pre-synaptic and post-
synaptic activity can substantially alter the dynamic
characteristics of the synaptic connection and therefore
either facilitate or inhibit signal transmission. In 1959,
the neuroscientists, Warren Sturgis McCulloch and
Walter Pitts published the first works on the processing
of neural networks.[4] They showed theoretically that
networks of artificial neurons could implement logical,
arithmetic, and symbolic functions. Simplified models
of biological neurons were set up, now usually called
perceptrons or artificial neurons. These simple models
accounted for neural summation (i.e., potentials at the
post-synaptic membrane will summate in the cell
body). Later models also provided for excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic transmission.
The connections between neurons in the brain are much more complex than those of the artificial neurons
used in the connectionist neural computing models of artificial neural networks. The basic kinds of
connections between neurons are synapses: both chemical and electrical synapses.

The establishment of synapses enables the connection of neurons
into millions of overlapping, and interlinking neural circuits.
Presynaptic proteins called neurexins are central to this process.[5]
One principle by which neurons work is neural summation -
potentials at the postsynaptic membrane will sum up in the cell
body. If the depolarization of the neuron at the axon hillock goes
above threshold an action potential will occur that travels down the
axon to the terminal endings to transmit a signal to other neurons.
Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is realized mostly by
excitatory 
postsynaptic 
potentials 
(EPSPs), 
and 
inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs).
On the electrophysiological level, there are various phenomena
which alter the response characteristics of individual synapses
(called synaptic plasticity) and individual neurons (intrinsic
plasticity). These are often divided into short-term plasticity and
long-term plasticity. Long-term synaptic plasticity is often
contended to be the most likely memory substrate. Usually, the term
""neuroplasticity"" refers to changes in the brain that are caused by
activity or experience.
Connections display temporal and spatial characteristics. Temporal characteristics refers to the continuously
modified activity-dependent efficacy of synaptic transmission, called spike-timing-dependent plasticity. It
has been observed in several studies that the synaptic efficacy of this transmission can undergo short-term
increase (called facilitation) or decrease (depression) according to the activity of the presynaptic neuron.
The induction of long-term changes in synaptic efficacy, by long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression
(LTD), depends strongly on the relative timing of the onset of the excitatory postsynaptic potential and the
postsynaptic action potential. LTP is induced by a series of action potentials which cause a variety of
biochemical responses. Eventually, the reactions cause the expression of new receptors on the cellular
membranes of the postsynaptic neurons or increase the efficacy of the existing receptors through
phosphorylation.
Backpropagating action potentials cannot occur because after an action potential travels down a given
segment of the axon, the m gates on voltage-gated sodium channels close, thus blocking any transient
opening of the h gate from causing a change in the intracellular sodium ion (Na+) concentration, and
preventing the generation of an action potential back towards the cell body. In some cells, however, neural
backpropagation does occur through the dendritic branching and may have important effects on synaptic
plasticity and computation.
A neuron in the brain requires a single signal to a neuromuscular junction to stimulate contraction of the
postsynaptic muscle cell. In the spinal cord, however, at least 75 afferent neurons are required to produce
firing. This picture is further complicated by variation in time constant between neurons, as some cells can
experience their EPSPs over a wider period of time than others.
Model of a neural circuit in the
cerebellum
While in synapses in the developing brain synaptic depression has been particularly widely observed it has
been speculated that it changes to facilitation in adult brains.
An example of a neural circuit is the trisynaptic circuit in the
hippocampus. Another is the Papez circuit linking the hypothalamus
to the limbic lobe. There are several neural circuits in the cortico-
basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. These circuits carry information
between the cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and back to the cortex.
The largest structure within the basal ganglia, the striatum, is seen
as having its own internal microcircuitry.[6]
Neural circuits in the spinal cord called central pattern generators
are responsible for controlling motor instructions involved in
rhythmic behaviours. Rhythmic behaviours include walking,
urination, and ejaculation. The central pattern generators are made
up of different groups of spinal interneurons.[7]
There are four principal types of neural circuits that are responsible for a broad scope of neural functions.
These circuits are a diverging circuit, a converging circuit, a reverberating circuit, and a parallel after-
discharge circuit.[8]
In a diverging circuit, one neuron synapses with a number of postsynaptic cells. Each of these may synapse
with many more making it possible for one neuron to stimulate up to thousands of cells. This is exemplified
in the way that thousands of muscle fibers can be stimulated from the initial input from a single motor
neuron.[8]
In a converging circuit, inputs from many sources are converged into one output, affecting just one neuron
or a neuron pool. This type of circuit is exemplified in the respiratory center of the brainstem, which
responds to a number of inputs from different sources by giving out an appropriate breathing pattern.[8]
A reverberating circuit produces a repetitive output. In a signalling procedure from one neuron to another in
a linear sequence, one of the neurons may send a signal back to initiating neuron. Each time that the first
neuron fires, the other neuron further down the sequence fire again sending it back to the source. This
restimulates the first neuron and also allows the path of transmission to continue to its output. A resulting
repetitive pattern is the outcome that only stops if one or more of the synapses fail, or if an inhibitory feed
from another source causes it to stop. This type of reverberating circuit is found in the respiratory center that
sends signals to the respiratory muscles, causing inhalation. When the circuit is interrupted by an inhibitory
signal the muscles relax causing exhalation. This type of circuit may play a part in epileptic seizures.[8]
In a parallel after-discharge circuit, a neuron inputs to several chains of neurons. Each chain is made up of a
different number of neurons but their signals converge onto one output neuron. Each synapse in the circuit
acts to delay the signal by about 0.5 msec, so that the more synapses there are, the longer is the delay to the
Circuitry
output neuron. After the input has stopped, the output will go on firing for some time. This type of circuit
does not have a feedback loop as does the reverberating circuit. Continued firing after the stimulus has
stopped is called after-discharge. This circuit type is found in the reflex arcs of certain reflexes.[8]
Different neuroimaging techniques have been developed to investigate the activity of neural circuits and
networks. The use of ""brain scanners"" or functional neuroimaging to investigate the structure or function of
the brain is common, either as simply a way of better assessing brain injury with high-resolution pictures, or
by examining the relative activations of different brain areas. Such technologies may include functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain positron emission tomography (brain PET), and computed axial
tomography (CAT) scans. Functional neuroimaging uses specific brain imaging technologies to take scans
from the brain, usually when a person is doing a particular task, in an attempt to understand how the
activation of particular brain areas is related to the task. In functional neuroimaging, especially fMRI, which
measures hemodynamic activity (using BOLD-contrast imaging) which is closely linked to neural activity,
PET, and electroencephalography (EEG) is used.
Connectionist models serve as a test platform for different hypotheses of representation, information
processing, and signal transmission. Lesioning studies in such models, e.g. artificial neural networks, where
parts of the nodes are deliberately destroyed to see how the network performs, can also yield important
insights in the working of several cell assemblies. Similarly, simulations of dysfunctional neurotransmitters
in neurological conditions (e.g., dopamine in the basal ganglia of Parkinson's patients) can yield insights
into the underlying mechanisms for patterns of cognitive deficits observed in the particular patient group.
Predictions from these models can be tested in patients or via pharmacological manipulations, and these
studies can in turn be used to inform the models, making the process iterative.
The modern balance between the connectionist approach and the single-cell approach in neurobiology has
been achieved through a lengthy discussion. In 1972, Barlow announced the single neuron revolution: ""our
perceptions are caused by the activity of a rather small number of neurons selected from a very large
population of predominantly silent cells.""[9] This approach was stimulated by the idea of grandmother cell
put forward two years earlier. Barlow formulated ""five dogmas"" of neuron doctrine. Recent studies of
'grandmother cell' and sparse coding phenomena develop and modify these ideas.[10] The single cell
experiments used intracranial electrodes in the medial temporal lobe (the hippocampus and surrounding
cortex). Modern development of concentration of measure theory (stochastic separation theorems) with
applications to artificial neural networks give mathematical background to unexpected effectiveness of small
neural ensembles in high-dimensional brain.[11]
Sometimes neural circuitries can become pathological and cause problems such as in Parkinson's disease
when the basal ganglia are involved.[12] Problems in the Papez circuit can also give rise to a number of
neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's.

Neural pathway
In neuroanatomy, a neural pathway is the connection formed by
axons that project from neurons to make synapses onto neurons in
another location, to enable neurotransmission (the sending of a
signal from one region of the nervous system to another). Neurons
are connected by a single axon, or by a bundle of axons known as a
nerve tract, or fasciculus.[1] Shorter neural pathways are found
within grey matter in the brain, whereas longer projections, made
up of myelinated axons, constitute white matter.
In the hippocampus, there are neural pathways involved in its
circuitry including the perforant pathway, that provides a
connectional route from the entorhinal cortex[2] to all fields of the
hippocampal formation, including the dentate gyrus, all CA fields
(including CA1),[3] and the subiculum.
Descending motor pathways of the pyramidal tracts travel from the
cerebral cortex to the brainstem or lower spinal cord.[4][5]
Ascending sensory tracts in the dorsal column-medial lemniscus
pathway (DCML) carry information from the periphery to the
cortex of the brain.
The first named pathways are evident to
the naked eye even in a poorly preserved
brain, and were named by the great
anatomists of the Renaissance using
cadaver material. Examples of these
include the great commissures of the brain
such as the corpus callosum (Latin, ""hard body""; not to be confused with the Latin word ""colossus"" - the
""huge"" statue), anterior commissure, and posterior commissure. Further examples include the pyramidal

Diagram showing cortical pathways
tract, crus cerebri (Latin, ""leg of the brain""), and cerebellar peduncles (Latin, ""little foot of the cerebellum"").
Note that these names describe the appearance of a structure but give no information on its function,
location, etc.
Later, as neuroanatomical knowledge became more sophisticated, the trend was toward naming pathways
by their origin and termination. For example, the nigrostriatal pathway runs from the substantia nigra (Latin,
""black substance"") to the corpus striatum (Latin, ""striped body""). This naming can extend to include any
number of structures in a pathway, such that the cerebellorubrothalamocortical pathway originates in the
cerebellum, synapses in the red nucleus (""ruber"" in Latin), on to the thalamus, and finally terminating in the
cerebral cortex.
Sometimes, these two naming conventions coexist. For example, the name ""pyramidal tract"" has been
mainly supplanted by lateral corticospinal tract in most texts. Note that the ""old"" name was primarily
descriptive, evoking the pyramids of antiquity, from the appearance of this neural pathway in the medulla
oblongata. The ""new"" name is based primarily on its origin (in the primary motor cortex, Brodmann area 4)
and termination (onto the alpha motor neurons of the spinal cord).
In the cerebellum, one of the two major pathways is that of the mossy fibers. Mossy fibers project directly to
the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers - granule cells - parallel fibers
- Purkinje cells - deep nuclei. The other main pathway is from the climbing fibers and these project to
Purkinje cells and also send collaterals directly to the deep nuclei.[6]
In general, neurons receive information either at their
dendrites or cell bodies. The axon of a nerve cell is, in
general, responsible for transmitting information over a
relatively long distance. Therefore, most neural
pathways are made up of axons. If the axons have
myelin sheaths, then the pathway appears bright white
because myelin is primarily lipid. If most or all of the
axons lack myelin sheaths (i.e., are unmyelinated), then
the pathway will appear a darker beige color, which is
generally called grey.
Some 
neurons 
are 
responsible 
for 
conveying
information over long distances. For example, motor
neurons, which travel from the spinal cord to the
muscle, can have axons up to a meter in length in humans. The longest axon in the human body belongs to
the Sciatic Nerve and runs from the great toe to the base of the spinal cord. These are archetypal examples
of neural pathways.
Neural pathways in the basal ganglia in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, are seen as
controlling different aspects of behaviour. This regulation is enabled by the dopamine pathways. It has been
proposed that the dopamine system of pathways is the overall organiser of the neural pathways that are seen

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Neuron
Within a nervous system, a neuron, neurone, or nerve cell is
an electrically excitable cell that fires electric signals called
action 
potentials 
across 
a 
neural 
network. 
Neurons
communicate with other cells via synapses, which are
specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of
chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the
presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap.
Neurons are the main components of nervous tissue in all
animals except sponges and Placozoa. Non-animals like plants
and fungi do not have nerve cells. Molecular evidence suggests
that the ability to generate electric signals first appeared in
evolution some 700 to 800 million years ago, during the Tonian
period. Predecessors of neurons were the peptidergic secretory
cells. They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled
cells to create post-synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that
generate fast electrical signals. The ability to generate electric
signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous
system.[1]
Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their
function. Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch,
sound, or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs, and
they send signals to the spinal cord or brain. Motor neurons
receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control
everything from muscle contractions[2] to glandular output.
Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same
region of the brain or spinal cord. When multiple neurons are
functionally connected together, they form what is called a
neural circuit.
Neurons are special cells which are made up of some structures
that are common to all other eukaryotic cells such as the cell
body (soma), a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular
components.[3] Additionally, neurons have other unique
structures such as dendrites, and a single axon.[3] The soma is a compact structure, and the axon and
dendrites are filaments extruding from the soma. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few
hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock and
travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a constant

diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are axon terminals, where the neuron can transmit a
signal across the synapse to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axon. The term neurite is
used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly when the cell is undifferentiated.
Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the
majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. However, synapses
can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite. The signaling process is partly
electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of voltage gradients
across their membranes. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron
generates an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential. This potential travels rapidly
along the axon and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them. Synaptic signals may be excitatory or
inhibitory, increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma.
In most cases, neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood.
Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.
Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system,
along with the glial cells that give them structural and
metabolic support.[4] The nervous system is made up of the
central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal
cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes the
autonomic, enteric and somatic nervous systems.[5] In
vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central
nervous system, but some reside in peripheral ganglia, and
many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as
the retina and cochlea.
Axons may bundle into fascicles that make up the nerves in the
peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire make up
cables). Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are
called tracts.
Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission
of cellular signals. Given their diversity of functions performed in
different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their
shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma
of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter.[6]
The soma is the body of the neuron. As it contains the
nucleus, most protein synthesis occurs here. The
nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in
diameter.[7]
The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with
many branches. This overall shape and structure are

referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron
occurs via the dendritic spine.
The axon is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of
thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries nerve
signals away from the soma and carries some types of information back to it. Many neurons
have only one axon, but this axon may--and usually will--undergo extensive branching,
enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from
the soma is called the axon hillock. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock
also has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most
easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. In
electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative threshold potential.
While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region
can also receive input from other neurons.
The axon terminal is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains
synapses. Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals
are released to communicate with target neurons. In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon
terminal, a neuron may have en passant boutons, which are located along the length of the
axon.
The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its
various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons
often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.[8]
Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically
only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral
nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10-25
micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell
nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human motor neuron can
be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the
toes.
Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the
posterior column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults.
Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along
the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about
axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon, an ideal
experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size
(0.5-1 millimeter thick, several centimeters long).
Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic[9]
however, stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate
functional neurons throughout the life of an organism (see
neurogenesis). Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells. They have
been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell-like
characteristic of pluripotency.

Like all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid
molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it.[10] A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical
insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active.
These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion
pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are
permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be
switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are
chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with
chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The ion materials include sodium, potassium, chloride,
and calcium. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the
membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it
provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the
membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the
membrane.
Numerous microscopic clumps called Nissl bodies (or Nissl
substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a
basophilic (""base-loving"") dye. These structures consist of
rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA.
Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz
Nissl (1860-1919), they are involved in protein synthesis and
their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells
are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as aniline
or (weakly) haematoxylin[11] highlight negatively charged
components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the
ribosomal RNA.
The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex
mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments,
which 
together 
with 
neurotubules 
(neuronal
microtubules) are assembled into larger neurofibrils.[12]
Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as
neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is
byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and
lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which
accumulate with age.[13][14][15] Other structural
proteins that are important for neuronal function are
actin and the tubulin of microtubules. Class III b-
tubulin is found almost exclusively in neurons. Actin is
predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites
during neuronal development. There the actin
dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule.[16]
Histology and internal structure

There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. Typical axons almost
never contain ribosomes, except some in the initial segment. Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic
reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases.
Neurons vary in shape and size and can be classified by their
morphology and function.[18] The anatomist Camillo Golgi
grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to
move signals over long distances and type II with short axons,
which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can
be further classified by the location of the soma. The basic
morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor
neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin
axon covered by a myelin sheath. The dendritic tree wraps
around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons.
The end of the axon has branching axon terminals that release
neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between
the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.
Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as:[19]
Unipolar: single process. Unipolar cells are
exclusively sensory neurons. Their dendrites are
receiving sensory information, sometimes directly
from the stimulus itself. The cell bodies of unipolar
neurons are always found in ganglia. Sensory
reception is a peripheral function, so the cell body is
in the periphery, though closer to the CNS in a
ganglion. The axon projects from the dendrite
endings, past the cell body in a ganglion, and into
the central nervous system.
Bipolar: 1 axon and 1 dendrite. They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium, and as part
of the retina.
Multipolar: 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites
Golgi I: neurons with long-projecting axonal processes; examples are pyramidal cells,
Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells
Golgi II: neurons whose axonal process projects locally; the best example is the granule
cell
Anaxonic: where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite(s)
Pseudounipolar: 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite

Some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their
location in the nervous system and distinct shape. Some examples
are:
Basket cells, interneurons that form a dense plexus of
terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the
cortex and cerebellum
Betz cells, large motor neurons
Lugaro cells, interneurons of the cerebellum

Unipolar brush cells, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft
Granule cells, a type of Golgi II neuron
Anterior horn cells, motoneurons located in the spinal cord
Spindle cells, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain
Afferent neurons convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system
and are also called sensory neurons.
Efferent neurons (motor neurons) transmit signals from the central nervous system to the
effector cells.
Interneurons connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system.
Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send
information from the brain.
A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors. The effect
upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated, not by the presynaptic
neuron or by the neurotransmitter. A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key, and a receptor as a lock:
the same neurotransmitter can activate multiple types of receptors. Receptors can be classified broadly as
excitatory (causing an increase in firing rate), inhibitory (causing a decrease in firing rate), or modulatory
(causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).
The two most common (90%+) neurotransmitters in the brain, glutamate and GABA, have largely
consistent actions. Glutamate acts on several types of receptors, and has effects that are excitatory at
ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors. Similarly, GABA acts on several

types of receptors, but all of them have inhibitory effects (in adult animals, at least). Because of this
consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as ""excitatory neurons"",
and cells that release GABA as ""inhibitory neurons"". Some other types of neurons have consistent effects,
for example, ""excitatory"" motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine, and ""inhibitory"" spinal
neurons that release glycine.
The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute. Rather, it depends on the
class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a
single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and
modulatory effects on others still. For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the
neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF bipolar cells are, like most neurons,
excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead
inhibited by glutamate, because they lack typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class
of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors.[20] When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing
glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes
the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them.
It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic
neuron, based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons typically
dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex, whereas somatostatin-expressing
neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.[21]
Neurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage oscillatory
patterns.[22] So neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics:
Tonic or regular spiking. Some neurons are typically constantly (tonically) active, typically
firing at a constant frequency. Example: interneurons in neurostriatum.
Phasic or bursting. Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic.
Fast-spiking. Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates, for example some types of
cortical inhibitory interneurons, cells in globus pallidus, retinal ganglion cells.[23][24]
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers passed from one neuron
to another neuron or to a muscle cell or gland cell.
Cholinergic neurons - acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is
released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft.
It acts as a ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and
metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic
receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels
composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine.
Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+
depolarization and increases the probability of
presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl
coenzyme A.
Adrenergic neurons - noradrenaline. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is released from most
postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system onto two sets of GPCRs: alpha
Discharge patterns
Neurotransmitter
adrenoceptors and beta adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline is one of the three common
catecholamine neurotransmitter, and the most prevalent of them in the peripheral nervous
system; as with other catecholamines, it is synthesised from tyrosine.
GABAergic neurons - gamma aminobutyric acid. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the
central nervous system (CNS), along with glycine. GABA has a homologous function to ACh,
gating anion channels that allow Cl- ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl- causes
hyperpolarization within the neuron, decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as
the voltage becomes more negative (for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage
threshold must be reached). GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the
enzyme glutamate decarboxylase.
Glutamatergic neurons - glutamate. Glutamate is one of two primary excitatory amino acid
neurotransmitters, along with aspartate. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three
of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor
(often referred to as GPCR).
1. AMPA and Kainate receptors function as cation channels permeable to Na+ cation
channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
2. NMDA receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to Ca2+. The
function of NMDA receptors depend on glycine receptor binding as a co-agonist within
the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.
3. Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic
excitability.
Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted,
resulting in brain damage. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released
from presynaptic neurons, causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than
normal outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca2+ and Na+ entering the
post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid
glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase.
Dopaminergic neurons--dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1
and D5) Gs-coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and
D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA.
Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre- and post-synaptic
neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to
Parkinson's disease. Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine is
catalyzed into levodopa (or L-DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxlase, and levodopa is then converted
into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase.
Serotonergic neurons--serotonin. Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as
excitatory or inhibitory. Of its four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is a ligand-gated
cation channel. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase, and
then further by decarboxylase. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to
depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment,
such as Prozac and Zoloft.
Purinergic neurons--ATP. ATP is a neurotransmitter acting at both ligand-gated ion channels
(P2X receptors) and GPCRs (P2Y) receptors. ATP is, however, best known as a
cotransmitter. Such purinergic signalling can also be mediated by other purines like
adenosine, which particularly acts at P2Y receptors.

Histaminergic neurons--histamine. Histamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter and
neuromodulator. Histamine-producing neurons are found in the tuberomammillary nucleus of
the hypothalamus.[25] Histamine is involved in arousal and regulating sleep/wake behaviors.
Since 2012 there has been a push from the cellular and computational neuroscience community to come up
with a universal classification of neurons that will apply to all neurons in the brain as well as across species.
This is done by considering the three essential qualities of all neurons: electrophysiology, morphology, and
the individual transcriptome of the cells. Besides being universal this classification has the advantage of
being able to classify astrocytes as well. A method called patch-sequencing in which all three qualities can
be measured at once is used extensively by the Allen Institute for Brain Science.[26] In 2023, a
comprehensive cell atlas of the adult, and developing human brain at the transcriptional, epigenetic, and
functional levels was created through an international collaboration of researchers using the most cutting-
edge molecular biology approaches.[27]
Neurons communicate with each other via
synapses, where either the axon terminal of
one cell contacts another neuron's dendrite,
soma or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such
as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have
over 
1000 
dendritic 
branches, 
making
connections with tens of thousands of other
cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular
neurons of the supraoptic nucleus, have only
one or two dendrites, each of which receives
thousands of synapses.
Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory, either
increasing or decreasing activity in the target
neuron, respectively. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically
conductive junctions between cells.[28]

pump and channel proteins
When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing
calcium ions to enter the terminal. Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules
to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse
across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. High cytosolic calcium in the
axon terminal triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy
metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission.[29]
An autapse is a synapse in which a neuron's axon connects to its own dendrites.
The human brain has some 8.6 x 1010 (eighty six billion) neurons.[30][31] Each neuron has on average
7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child
has about 1015 synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates
vary for an adult, ranging from 1014 to 5 x 1014 synapses (100 to 500 trillion).[32]
Beyond electrical and chemical signaling, studies suggest
neurons in healthy human brains can also communicate
through:
force generated by the enlargement of dendritic
spines[33]
the transfer of proteins - transneuronally
transported proteins (TNTPs)[34][35]
They can also get modulated by input from the
environment and hormones released from other parts of the
organism,[36] which could be influenced more or less
directly by neurons. This also applies to neurotrophins such
as BDNF. The gut microbiome is also connected with the
brain.[37] Neurons also communicate with microglia, the
brain's main immune cells via specialised contact sites,
called ""somatic junctions"". These connections enable
microglia to constantly monitor and regulate neuronal
functions, and exert neuroprotection, when needed.[38]
In 1937 John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant
axon could be used to study neuronal electrical
properties.[39] It is larger than but similar to human
neurons, making it easier to study. By inserting electrodes
into the squid giant axons, accurate measurements were
made of the membrane potential.
Nonelectrochemical signaling
Mechanisms for propagating action
potentials
The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage-gated ion channels that allow the neuron to
generate and propagate an electrical signal (an action potential). Some neurons also generate subthreshold
membrane potential oscillations. These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying ions
including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and calcium (Ca2+).
Several stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity, including pressure, stretch, chemical
transmitters, and changes of the electric potential across the cell membrane.[40] Stimuli cause specific ion-
channels within the cell membrane to open, leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane, changing
the membrane potential. Neurons must maintain the specific electrical properties that define their neuron
type.[41]
Thin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials, but thicker
axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction,
many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells:
oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The
sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst
using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about
1 mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion
channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central
nervous system.
Some neurons do not generate action potentials, but instead generate a graded electrical signal, which in
turn causes graded neurotransmitter release. Such non-spiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or
interneurons, because they cannot carry signals long distances.
Neural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons.
The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the
individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationships among the electrical activities of the
neurons within the ensemble.[42] It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog
information.[43]
The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron
responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation, like brighter image/louder
sound, does not produce a stronger signal but can increase firing frequency.[44]: 
31  Receptors respond in
different ways to stimuli. Slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to a steady stimulus and produce a
steady rate of firing. Tonic receptors most often respond to increased stimulus intensity by increasing their
firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be
likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) requires more
photons, as the photons can not become ""stronger"" for a specific frequency.
Other receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with a
steady stimulus; examples include skin which, when touched causes neurons to fire, but if the object
maintains even pressure, the neurons stop firing. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to
pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function.

All-or-none principle
As long as the stimulus reaches the threshold, the full
response would be given. A larger stimulus does not
result in a larger response, and vice versa.[44]:

The pacinian corpuscle is one such structure. It has
concentric layers like an onion, which form around
the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the
corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is
transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is
steady, the stimulus ends; thus, these neurons
typically respond with a transient depolarization
during the initial deformation and again when the
pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to
change shape again. Other types of adaptation are
important in extending the function of a number of
other neurons.[45]
The German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer
introduced the term neuron in 1891,[46] based on
the ancient Greek neuron neuron 'sinew, cord,
nerve'.[47]
The word was adopted in French with the spelling neurone. That spelling was also used by many writers in
English,[48] but has now become rare in American usage and uncommon in British usage.[49][47]

primary functional unit of

To make the structure of
individual neurons visible,
Ramon y Cajal improved a
silver staining process that
had been developed by Camillo Golgi.[50] The improved process
involves a technique called ""double impregnation"" and is still in
use.
In 1888 Ramon y Cajal published a paper about the bird
cerebellum. In this paper, he stated that he could not find evidence
for anastomosis between axons and dendrites and called each
nervous element ""an absolutely autonomous canton.""[50][46] This
became known as the neuron doctrine, one of the central tenets of
modern neuroscience.[50]

both of which are multipolar.
In 1891, the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer wrote a highly influential review of the neuron
doctrine in which he introduced the term neuron to describe the anatomical and physiological unit of the
nervous system.[51][52]
The silver impregnation stains are a useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because, for reasons
unknown, it stains only a small percentage of cells in a tissue, exposing the complete micro structure of
individual neurons without much overlap from other cells.[53]
The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are
the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. The
theory was put forward by Santiago Ramon y Cajal in the late 19th
century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a
meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units.
Later discoveries yielded refinements to the doctrine. For example,
glial cells, which are non-neuronal, play an essential role in
information processing.[54] Also, electrical synapses are more
common 
than 
previously 
thought,[55] 
comprising 
direct,
cytoplasmic connections between neurons. In fact, neurons can
form even tighter couplings: the squid giant axon arises from the
fusion of multiple axons.[56]
Ramon y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization,
which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell
body and transmits them, as action potentials, along the axon in one
direction: away from the cell body.[57] The Law of Dynamic
Polarization has important exceptions; dendrites can serve as
synaptic output sites of neurons[58] and axons can receive synaptic
inputs.[59]
Although neurons are often described of as ""fundamental units"" of the brain, they perform internal
computations. Neurons integrate input within dendrites, and this complexity is lost in models that assume
neurons to be a fundamental unit. Dendritic branches can be modeled as spatial compartments, whose
activity is related due to passive membrane properties, but may also be different depending on input from
synapses. Compartmental modelling of dendrites is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of
neurons that are too small to record with electrodes, as is the case for Drosophila melanogaster.[60]
The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species.[61] In a human, there are an
estimated 10-20 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 55-70 billion neurons in the cerebellum.[62] By
contrast, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just 302 neurons, making it an ideal model
organism as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a
common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex

are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms
in much simpler experimental systems.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves (neuropathy) that is
characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs extending to
the hands and arms in advanced stages. Presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common
inherited neurological disorders, affecting 36 in 100,000 people.[63]
Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known simply as Alzheimer's, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized
by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric
symptoms or behavioral changes.[64] The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory
(amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with
illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive
(intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and
recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.[65][66]
Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as Parkinsons, is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous
system that often impairs motor skills and speech.[67] Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions
called movement disorders.[68] It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical
movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary
symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused
by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the
brain. Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems.
PD is both chronic and progressive.
Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during
simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at
the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected
cases, thymectomy.
Demyelination is a process characterized by the gradual loss of the
myelin sheath enveloping nerve fibers. When myelin deteriorates,
signal conduction along nerves can be significantly impaired or lost,
and the nerve eventually withers. Demyelination may affect both
central and peripheral nervous systems, contributing to various
neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre
syndrome, 
and 
chronic 
inflammatory

polyneuropathy. Although demyelination is often caused by an autoimmune reaction, it may also be caused
by viral infections, metabolic disorders, trauma, and some medications.
Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts,
axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is the rapid separation of the proximal and
distal ends, occurring within 30 minutes of injury.[69] Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma,
and eventually leads to bead-like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner
organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the
paranodal regions at the site of injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and
eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by the
influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete
fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hours in the PNS and longer in the CNS. The signaling
pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown.
Neurons are born through the process of neurogenesis, in which neural stem cells divide to produce
differentiated neurons. Once fully differentiated neurons are formed, they are no longer capable of
undergoing mitosis. Neurogenesis primarily occurs in the embryo of most organisms.
Adult neurogenesis can occur and studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only
for a minority of cells, and that the vast majority of neurons in the neocortex forms before birth and persists
without replacement. The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans, and its contribution to
cognition are controversial, with conflicting reports published in 2018.[70]
The body contains a variety of stem cell types that have the capacity to differentiate into neurons.
Researchers found a way to transform human skin cells into nerve cells using transdifferentiation, in which
""cells are forced to adopt new identities"".[71]
During neurogenesis in the mammalian brain, progenitor and stem cells progress from proliferative divisions
to differentiative divisions. This progression leads to the neurons and glia that populate cortical layers.
Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells,
and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic
modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine
demethylation.[72] These modifications are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult
mammalian brain. DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).
Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative
reactions (e.g. 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair
(BER) pathway.[72]
At different stages of mammalian nervous system development two DNA repair processes are employed in
the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. These pathways are homologous recombinational repair used in
proliferating neural precursor cells, and non-homologous end joining used mainly at later developmental
stages[73]
Axonal degeneration
Neurogenesis
Intercellular communication between developing neurons and microglia is also indispensable for proper
neurogenesis and brain development.[74]
Peripheral axons can regrow if they are severed,[75] but one neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one
of another type (Llinas' law).[22]

Anatomical terms of microanatomy
Node of Ranvier
In neuroscience and anatomy, nodes of Ranvier (/'ra:nvieI/
RAHN-vee-ay),[1][2] also known as myelin-sheath gaps, occur
along a myelinated axon where the axolemma is exposed to the
extracellular space. Nodes of Ranvier are uninsulated and
highly enriched in ion channels, allowing them to participate in
the exchange of ions required to regenerate the action potential.
Nerve conduction in myelinated axons is referred to as saltatory
conduction (from Latin saltus 'leap, jump') due to the manner in
which the action potential seems to ""jump"" from one node to
the next along the axon. This results in faster conduction of the
action potential.
Many vertebrate axons are surrounded by a myelin sheath,
allowing rapid and efficient saltatory (""jumping"") propagation
of action potentials. The contacts between neurons and glial
cells display a very high level of spatial and temporal
organization in myelinated fibers. The myelinating glial cells -
oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), and
Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) - are
wrapped around the axon, leaving the axolemma relatively
uncovered at the regularly spaced nodes of Ranvier.
The internodal glial membranes are fused to form compact
myelin, whereas the cytoplasm-filled paranodal loops of
myelinating cells are spirally wrapped around the axon at both
sides of the nodes. This organization demands a tight
developmental control and the formation of a variety of
specialized zones of contact between different areas of the
myelinating cell membrane. Each node of Ranvier is flanked by
paranodal regions where helicoidally wrapped glial loops are
attached to the axonal membrane by a septate-like junction.
The segment between nodes of Ranvier is termed as the
internode, and its outermost part that is in contact with
paranodes is referred to as the juxtaparanodal region. The nodes

The

are 
the

segments and the gaps between are
referred to as nodes. The size and the
spacing of the internodes vary with the
fiber 
diameter 
in 
a 
curvilinear
relationship that is optimized for
maximal conduction velocity.[3] The size of the nodes span from 1-2 mm whereas the internodes can be up
to (and occasionally even greater than)1.5 millimetres long, depending on the axon diameter and fiber type.
The structure of the node and the flanking paranodal regions are distinct from the internodes under the
compact myelin sheath, but are very similar in CNS and PNS. The axon is exposed to the extra-cellular
environment at the node and is constricted in its diameter. The decreased axon size reflects a higher packing
density of neurofilaments in this region, which are less heavily phosphorylated and are transported more
slowly.[4] Vesicles and other organelles are also increased at the nodes, which suggest that there is a
bottleneck of axonal transport in both directions as well as local axonal-glial signaling.
When a longitudinal section is made through a myelinating Schwann cell at the node, three distinctive
segments are represented: the stereotypic internode, the paranodal region, and the node itself. In the
internodal region, the Schwann cell has an outer collar of cytoplasm, a compact myelin sheath, and inner
collar of cytoplasm, and the axolemma. At the paranodal regions, the paranodal cytoplasm loops contact
thickenings of the axolemma to form septate -like junctions. In the node alone, the axolemma is contacted
by several Schwann microvilli and contains a dense cytoskeletal undercoating.
Although freeze fracture studies have revealed that the nodal axolemma in both the CNS and PNS is
enriched in intra-membranous particles (IMPs) compared to the internode, there are some structural
differences reflecting their cellular constituents.[4] In the PNS, specialized microvilli project from the outer
collar of Schwann cells and come very close to nodal axolemma of large fibers. The projections of the
Schwann cells are perpendicular to the node and are radiating from the central axons. However, in the
CNS, one or more of the astrocytic processes come in close vicinity of the nodes. Researchers declare that
these processes stem from multi-functional astrocytes, as opposed to from a population of astrocytes
dedicated to contacting the node. On the other hand, in the PNS, the basal lamina that surrounds the
Schwann cells is continuous across the node.

Composition
The nodes of Ranvier Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and high density of voltage-gated Na+ channels that generate
action potentials. A sodium channel consists of a pore-forming a subunit and two accessory b subunits,
which anchor the channel to extra-cellular and intra-cellular components. The nodes of Ranvier in the
central and peripheral nervous systems mostly consist of aNaV1.6 and b1 subunits.[5] The extra-cellular
region of b subunits can associate with itself and other proteins, such as tenascin R and the cell-adhesion
molecules neurofascin and contactin. Contactin is also present at nodes in the CNS and interaction with this
molecule enhances the surface expression of Na+ channels.
Ankyrin has been found to be bounded to bIV spectrin, a spectrin isoform enriched at nodes of Ranvier and
axon initial segments. The PNS nodes are surrounded by Schwann cell microvilli, which contain ERMs
and EBP50 that may provide a connection to actin microfilaments. Several extracellular matrix proteins are
enriched at nodes of Ranvier, including tenascin-R, Bral-1, and proteoglycan NG2, as well as phosphacan
and versican V2. At CNS nodes, the axonal proteins also include contactin; however, Schwann cell
microvilli are replaced by astrocyte perinodal extensions.
The molecular organization of the nodes corresponds to their specialized function in impulse propagation.
The level of sodium channels in the node versus the internode suggests that the number IMPs corresponds
to sodium channels. Potassium channels are essentially absent in the nodal axolemma, whereas they are
highly concentrated in the paranodal axolemma and Schwann cell membranes at the node.[4] The exact
function of potassium channels have not quite been revealed, but it is known that they may contribute to the
rapid repolarization of the action potentials or play a vital role in buffering the potassium ions at the nodes.
This highly asymmetric distribution of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels is in striking contrast
to their diffuse distribution in unmyelinated fibers.[4][6]
The filamentous network subjacent to the nodal membrane contains cytoskeletal proteins called spectrin and
ankyrin. The high density of ankyrin at the nodes may be functionally significant because several of the
proteins that are populated at the nodes share the ability to bind to ankyrin with extremely high affinity. All
of these proteins, including ankyrin, are enriched in the initial segment of axons which suggests a functional
relationship. Now the relationship of these molecular components to the clustering of sodium channels at
the nodes is still not known. Although some cell-adhesion molecules have been reported to be present at the
nodes inconsistently; however, a variety of other molecules are known to be highly populated at the glial
membranes of the paranodal regions where they contribute to its organization and structural integrity.
The complex changes that the Schwann cell undergoes during the process of myelination of peripheral
nerve fibers have been observed and studied by many. The initial envelopment of the axon occurs without
interruption along the entire extent of the Schwann cell. This process is sequenced by the in-folding of the
Schwann cell surface so that a double membrane of the opposing faces of the in-folded Schwann cell
surface is formed. This membrane stretches and spirally wraps itself over and over as the in-folding of the
Schwann cell surface continues. As a result, the increase in the thickness of the extension of the myelin
sheath in its cross-sectional diameter is easily ascertained. It is also evident that each of the consecutive turns
of the spiral increases in size along the length of the axon as the number of turns increase. However, it is not

clear whether or not the increase in length of the myelin sheath can be accounted solely by the increase in
length of axon covered by each successive turn of the spiral, as previously explained. At the junction of two
Schwann cells along an axon, the directions of the lamellar overhang of the myelin endings are of opposite
sense.[7] This junction, adjacent of the Schwann cells, constitutes the region designated as the node of
Ranvier.
Researchers prove that in the developing CNS, Nav1.2 is initially expressed at all forming nodes of
Ranvier.[8] Upon maturation, nodal Nav1.2 is down-regulated and replaced by Nav1.6. Nav1.2 is also
expressed during PNS node formation, which suggests that the switching of Nav-channel subtypes is a
general phenomenon in the CNS and PNS. In this same investigation, it was shown that Nav1.6 and
Nav1.2 colocalize at many nodes of Ranvier during early myelination. This also led to the suggestion that
early clusters of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 channels are destined to later become nodes of Ranvier. Neurofascin is
also reported to be one of the first proteins to accumulate at newly forming nodes of Ranvier. They are also
found to provide the nucleation site for attachment of ankyrin G, Nav channels, and other proteins.[9] The
recent identification of the Schwann cell microvilli protein gliomedin as the likely binding partner of axonal
neurofascin brings forward substantial evidence for the importance of this protein in recruiting Nav
channels to the nodes of Ranvier. Furthermore, Lambert et al. and Eshed et al. also indicates that
neurofascin accumulates before Nav channels and is likely to have crucial roles in the earliest events
associated with node of Ranvier formation. Thus, multiple mechanisms may exist and work synergistically
to facilitate clustering of Nav channels at nodes of Ranvier.
The first event appears to be the accumulation of cell adhesion molecules such as NF186 or NrCAM. The
intra-cellular regions of these cell-adhesion molecules interact with ankyrin G, which serves as an anchor
for sodium channels. At the same time, the periaxonal extension of the glial cell wraps around the axon,
giving rise to the paranodal regions. This movement along the axon contributes significantly to the overall
formation of the nodes of Ranvier by permitting heminodes formed at the edges of neighboring glial cells to
fuse into complete nodes. Septate-like junctions form at the paranodes with the enrichment of NF155 in
glial paranodal loops. Immediately following the early differentiation of the nodal and paranodal regions,
potassium channels, Caspr2 and TAG1 accumulate in the juxta-paranodal regions. This accumulation
coincides directly with the formation of compact myelin. In mature nodal regions, interactions with the
intracellular proteins appear vital for the stability of all nodal regions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes do not
possess microvilli, but appear capable to initiate the clustering of some axonal proteins through secreted
factors. The combined effects of such factors with the subsequent movements generated by the wrapping of
oligodendrocyte periaxonal extension could account for the organization of CNS nodes of Ranvier.
An action potential is a spike of both positive and negative ionic discharge that travels along the membrane
of a cell.[10] The creation and conduction of action potentials represents a fundamental means of
communication in the nervous system. Action potentials represent rapid reversals in voltage across the

Function
Action potential
plasma membrane of axons. These rapid reversals are mediated by voltage-gated ion channels found in the
plasma membrane. The action potential travels from one location in the cell to another, but ion flow across
the membrane occurs only at the nodes of Ranvier. As a result, the action potential signal jumps along the
axon, from node to node, rather than propagating smoothly, as they do in axons that lack a myelin sheath.
The clustering of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels at the nodes permits this behavior.
Since an axon can be unmyelinated or myelinated, the action potential has two methods to travel down the
axon. These methods are referred to as continuous conduction for unmyelinated axons, and saltatory
conduction for myelinated axons. Saltatory conduction is defined as an action potential moving in discrete
jumps down a myelinated axon.
This process is outlined as the charge passively spreading to the next node of Ranvier to depolarize it to
threshold which will then trigger an action potential in this region which will then passively spread to the
next node and so on.
Saltatory conduction provides one advantage over conduction that occurs along an axon without myelin
sheaths. This is that the increased speed afforded by this mode of conduction assures faster interaction
between neurons. On the other hand, depending on the average firing rate of the neuron, calculations show
that the energetic cost of maintaining the resting potential of oligodendrocytes can outweigh the energy
savings of action potentials.[11] So, axon myelination does not necessarily save energy.
Mitochondria and other membranous organelles are normally enriched in the PNP region of peripheral
myelinated axons, especially those large caliber axons.[12] The actual physiological role of this
accumulation and factors that regulate it are not understood; however, it is known that mitochondria are
usually present in areas of the cell that expresses a high energy demand. In these same regions, they are also
understood to contain growth cones, synaptic terminals, and sites of action potential initiation and
regeneration, such as the nodes of Ranvier. In the synaptic terminals, mitochondria produce the ATP needed
to mobilize vesicles for neurotransmission. In the nodes of Ranvier, mitochondria serve as an important role
in impulse conduction by producing the ATP that is essential to maintain the activity of energy-demanding
ion pumps. Supporting this fact, about five times more mitochondria are present in the PNP axoplasm of
large peripheral axons than in the corresponding internodal regions of these fibers.[12]
Saltatory conduction in myelinated axons requires organization of the nodes of Ranvier, whereas voltage-
gated sodium channels are highly populated. Studies show that aII-Spectrin, a component of the
cytoskeleton is enriched at the nodes and paranodes at early stages and as the nodes mature, the expression

of this molecule disappears.[13] It is also proven that aII-Spectrin in the axonal cytoskeleton is absolutely
vital for stabilizing sodium channel clusters and organizing the mature node of Ranvier.
It has been shown previously that OMgp (oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein) clusters at nodes of
Ranvier and may regulate paranodal architecture, node length and axonal sprouting at nodes.[14] However,
a follow-up study showed that the antibody used previously to identify OMgp at nodes crossreacts with
another node-enriched component versican V2 and that OMgp is not required for the integrity of nodes and
paranodes, arguing against the previously reported localization and proposed functions of OMgp at
nodes.[15]
The proteins in these excitable domains of neuron when injured may result in cognitive disorders and
various neuropathic ailments.
The myelin sheath of long nerves was discovered and named by German
pathological anatomist Rudolf Virchow[16] in 1854.[17] French pathologist and
anatomist Louis-Antoine Ranvier later discovered the nodes, or gaps, in the
myelin sheath that now bear his name. Born in Lyon, Ranvier was one of the
most prominent histologists of the late 19th century. Ranvier abandoned
pathological studies in 1867 and became an assistant of physiologist Claude
Bernard. He was the chairman of General Anatomy at the College de France in
1875.
His refined histological techniques and his work on both injured and normal
nerve fibers became world-renowned. His observations on fiber nodes and the
degeneration and regeneration of cut fibers had a great influence on Parisian

neurology at the Salpetriere. Soon afterwards, he discovered gaps in sheaths of nerve fibers, which were
later called the Nodes of Ranvier. This discovery later led Ranvier to careful histological examination of
myelin sheaths and Schwann cells.[18]

Parasympathetic nervous system
The parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) is one of the
three divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the others
being the sympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous
system.[1][2] The enteric nervous system is sometimes
considered part of the autonomic nervous system, and
sometimes considered an independent system.[3]
The autonomic nervous system is responsible for regulating the
body's unconscious actions. The parasympathetic system is
responsible for stimulation of ""rest-and-digest"" or ""feed-and-
breed""[4] activities that occur when the body is at rest,
especially after eating, including sexual arousal, salivation,
lacrimation (tears), urination, digestion, and defecation. Its
action is described as being complementary to that of the
sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for
stimulating activities associated with the fight-or-flight
response.
Nerve fibres of the parasympathetic nervous system arise from
the central nervous system. Specific nerves include several
cranial nerves, specifically the oculomotor nerve, facial nerve,
glossopharyngeal nerve, and vagus nerve. Three spinal nerves
in the sacrum (S2-4), commonly referred to as the pelvic
splanchnic nerves, also act as parasympathetic nerves.
Owing to its location, the parasympathetic system is commonly
referred to as having ""craniosacral outflow"", which stands in
contrast to the sympathetic nervous system, which is said to
have ""thoracolumbar outflow"".[5]
The parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral 
[6][7]
branches 
of 
the 
peripheral 
nervous 
system 
(PNS).
Parasympathetic nerve supply arises through three primary
areas:
1. Certain cranial nerves in the cranium, namely the
preganglionic parasympathetic nerves (CN III, CN
VII, CN IX and CN X) usually arise from specific
nuclei in the central nervous system (CNS) and
synapse at one of four parasympathetic ganglia:
ciliary, pterygopalatine, otic, or submandibular. From
these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves

near thoracic viscera (esophagus, trachea, heart,
lungs) and abdominal viscera (stomach, pancreas,
liver, kidneys, small intestine, and about half of the
large intestine). The vagus innervation ends at the
junction between the midgut and hindgut, just before
the splenic flexure of the transverse colon.
3. The pelvic splanchnic efferent preganglionic nerve
cell bodies reside in the lateral gray horn of the spinal cord at the T12-L1 vertebral levels
(the spinal cord terminates at the L1-L2 vertebrae with the conus medullaris), and their
axons exit the vertebral column as S2-S4 spinal nerves through the sacral foramina.[8] Their
axons continue away from the CNS to synapse at an autonomic ganglion. The
parasympathetic ganglion where these preganglionic neurons synapse will be close to the
organ of innervation. This differs from the sympathetic nervous system, where synapses
between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther
away from the target organ.
As in the sympathetic nervous system, efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central
nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons. The first neuron in this pathway is referred to as
the preganglionic or presynaptic neuron. Its cell body sits in the central nervous system and its axon usually
extends to synapse with the dendrites of a postganglionic neuron somewhere else in the body. The axons of
presynaptic parasympathetic neurons are usually long, extending from the CNS into a ganglion that is either
very close to or embedded in their target organ. As a result, the postsynaptic parasympathetic nerve fibers
are very short.[9]: 
42 
The oculomotor nerve is responsible for a number of parasympathetic functions related to the eye.[10] The
oculomotor PNS fibers originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus in the central nervous system and travel
through the superior orbital fissure to synapse in the ciliary ganglion located just behind the orbit (eye).[11]
From the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers, a
continuation of the nasociliary nerve (a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1)).
The short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle (responsible for accommodation)
and the iris sphincter muscle, which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil (in response to light
or accommodation). There are two motors that are part of the oculomotor nerve known as the somatic motor
and visceral motor. The somatic motor is responsible for moving the eye in precise motions and for keeping
the eye fixated on an object. The visceral motor helps constrict the pupil.[12]
The parasympathetic aspect of the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular
salivary glands, the lacrimal gland, and the glands associated with the nasal cavity. The preganglionic fibers
originate within the CNS in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve (which some
consider a separate cranial nerve altogether) to connect with the facial nerve just distal (further out) to it
surfacing the central nervous system. Just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion (general sensory
ganglion) in the temporal bone, the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves. The first is
the greater petrosal nerve and the second is the chorda tympani. The greater petrosal nerve travels through
Cranial nerves
the middle ear and eventually combines with the deep petrosal nerve (sympathetic fibers) to form the nerve
of the pterygoid canal. The parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the
pterygopalatine ganglion, which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve
(CN V2). The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the pterygopalatine ganglion in several
directions. One division leaves on the zygomatic division of CN V2 and travels on a communicating branch
to unite with the lacrimal nerve (branch of the ophthalmic nerve of CN V1) before synapsing at the lacrimal
gland. These parasympathetic to the lacrimal gland control tear production.[13]
A separate group of parasympathetic leaving from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the descending palatine
nerves (CN V2 branch), which include the greater and lesser palatine nerves. The greater palatine
parasympathetic synapse on the hard palate and regulate mucus glands located there. The lesser palatine
nerve synapses at the soft palate and controls sparse taste receptors and mucus glands. Yet another set of
divisions from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the posterior, superior, and inferior lateral nasal nerves; and
the nasopalatine nerves (all branches of CN V2, maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve) that bring
parasympathetic innervation to glands of the nasal mucosa. The second parasympathetic branch that leaves
the facial nerve is the chorda tympani. This nerve carries secretomotor fibers to the submandibular and
sublingual glands. The chorda tympani travels through the middle ear and attaches to the lingual nerve
(mandibular division of trigeminal, CN V3). After joining the lingual nerve, the preganglionic fibers
synapse at the submandibular ganglion and send postganglionic fibers to the sublingual and submandibular
salivary glands.
The glossopharyngeal nerve has parasympathetic fibers that innervate the parotid salivary gland. The
preganglionic fibers depart CN IX as the tympanic nerve and continue to the middle ear where they make
up a tympanic plexus on the cochlear promontory of the mesotympanum. The tympanic plexus of nerves
rejoin and form the lesser petrosal nerve and exit through the foramen ovale to synapse at the otic ganglion.
From the otic ganglion postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel with the auriculotemporal nerve
(mandibular branch of trigeminal, CN V3) to the parotid salivary gland.
The vagus nerve, named after the Latin word vagus (because the nerve controls such a broad range of target
tissues - vagus in Latin literally means ""wandering""), has parasympathetic functions that originate in the
dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus ambiguus in the CNS. The vagus nerve is an unusual
cranial parasympathetic in that it does not join the trigeminal nerve in order to get to its target tissues.
Another peculiarity is that the vagus has an autonomic ganglion associated with it at approximately the level
of C1 vertebra. The vagus gives no parasympathetic to the cranium. The vagus nerve is hard to track
definitively due to its ubiquitous nature in the thorax and abdomen so the major contributions will be
discussed. Several parasympathetic nerves come off the vagus nerve as it enters the thorax. One nerve is the
recurrent laryngeal nerve, which becomes the inferior laryngeal nerve. From the left vagus nerve the
recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the aorta to travel back up to the larynx and proximal esophagus
while, from the right vagus nerve, the recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the right subclavian artery to
travel back up to the same location as its counterpart. These different paths are a direct result of
embryological development of the circulatory system. Each recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies the trachea
and the esophagus with parasympathetic secretomotor innervation for glands associated with them (and
other fibers that are not PN).
Vagus nerve
Another nerve that comes off the vagus nerves approximately at the level of entering the thorax are the
cardiac nerves. These cardiac nerves go on to form cardiac and pulmonary plexuses around the heart and
lungs. As the main vagus nerves continue into the thorax they become intimately linked with the esophagus
and sympathetic nerves from the sympathetic trunks to form the esophageal plexus. This is very efficient as
the major function of the vagus nerve from there on will be control of the gut smooth muscles and glands.
As the esophageal plexus enter the abdomen through the esophageal hiatus anterior and posterior vagus
trunks form. The vagus trunks then join with preaortic sympathetic ganglion around the aorta to disperse
with the blood vessels and sympathetic nerves throughout the abdomen. The extent of the parasympathetic
in the abdomen include the pancreas, kidneys, liver, gall bladder, stomach and gut tube. The vagus
contribution of parasympathetic continues down the gut tube until the end of the midgut. The midgut ends
two thirds of the way across the transverse colon near the splenic flexure.[14]
The pelvic splanchnic nerves, S2-4, work in tandem to innervate the pelvic viscera. Unlike in the cranium,
where one parasympathetic is in charge of one particular tissue or region, for the most part the pelvic
splanchnics each contribute fibers to pelvic viscera by traveling to one or more plexuses before being
dispersed to the target tissue. These plexuses are composed of mixed autonomic nerve fibers
(parasympathetic and sympathetic) and include the vesical, prostatic, rectal, uterovaginal, and inferior
hypogastric plexuses. The preganglionic neurons in the pathway do not synapse in a ganglion as in the
cranium but rather in the walls of the tissues or organs that they innervate. The fiber paths are variable and
each individual's autonomic nervous system in the pelvis is unique. The visceral tissues in the pelvis that the
parasympathetic nerve pathway controls include those of the urinary bladder, ureters, urinary sphincter, anal
sphincter, uterus, prostate, glands, vagina, and penis. Unconsciously, the parasympathetic will cause
peristaltic movements of the ureters and intestines, moving urine from the kidneys into the bladder and food
down the intestinal tract and, upon necessity, the parasympathetic will assist in excreting urine from the
bladder or defecation. Stimulation of the parasympathetic will cause the detrusor muscle (urinary bladder
wall) to contract and simultaneously relax the internal sphincter muscle between the bladder and the urethra,
allowing the bladder to void. Also, parasympathetic stimulation of the internal anal sphincter will relax this
muscle to allow defecation. There are other skeletal muscles involved with these processes but the
parasympathetic plays a huge role in continence and bowel retention.
A study published in 2016, suggests that all sacral autonomic output may be sympathetic; indicating that the
rectum, bladder and reproductive organs may only be innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. This
suggestion is based on detailed analysis of 15 phenotypic and ontogenetic factors differentiating
sympathetic from parasympathetic neurons in the mouse. Assuming that the reported findings most likely
applies to other mammals as well, this perspective suggests a simplified, bipartite architecture of the
autonomic nervous system, in which the parasympathetic nervous system receives input from cranial nerves
exclusively and the sympathetic nervous system from thoracic to sacral spinal nerves.[15]

The afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system, which transmit sensory information from the internal
organs of the body back to the central nervous system, are not divided into parasympathetic and
sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are.[9]: 
34-35  Instead, autonomic sensory information is conducted
by general visceral afferent fibers.
General visceral afferent sensations are mostly unconscious visceral motor reflex sensations from hollow
organs and glands that are transmitted to the CNS. While the unconscious reflex arcs normally are
undetectable, in certain instances they may send pain sensations to the CNS masked as referred pain. If the
Function
Sensation
peritoneal cavity becomes inflamed or if the bowel is suddenly distended, the body will interpret the afferent
pain stimulus as somatic in origin. This pain is usually non-localized. The pain is also usually referred to
dermatomes that are at the same spinal nerve level as the visceral afferent synapse.
Heart rate is largely controlled by the heart's internal pacemaker activity. Considering a healthy heart, the
main pacemaker is a collection of cells on the border of the atria and vena cava called the sinoatrial node.
Heart cells have the ability to generate electrical activity independent of external stimulation. As a result, the
cells of the node spontaneously generate electrical activity that is subsequently conducted throughout the
heart, resulting in a regular heart rate.
In absence of any external stimuli, sinoatrial pacing contributes to maintain the heart rate in the range of 60-
100 beats per minute (bpm).[17] At the same time, the two branches of the autonomic nervous system act in
a complementary way increasing or slowing the heart rate. In this context, the vagus nerve acts on sinoatrial
node slowing its conduction thus actively modulating vagal tone accordingly. This modulation is mediated
by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and downstream changes to ionic currents and calcium of heart
cells.[18]
The vagus nerve plays a crucial role in heart rate regulation by modulating the response of sinoatrial node;
vagal tone can be quantified by investigating heart rate modulation induced by vagal tone changes. As a
general consideration, increased vagal tone (and thus vagal action) is associated with a diminished and more
variable heart rate.[19][20] The main mechanism by which the parasympathetic nervous system acts on
vascular and cardiac control is the so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA is described as the
physiological and rhythmical fluctuation of heart rate at the respiration frequency, characterized by heart rate
increase during inspiration and decrease during expiration.
Another role that the parasympathetic nervous system plays is in sexual activity. In males, the cavernous
nerves from the prostatic plexus stimulate smooth muscles in the fibrous trabeculae of the coiled helicine
arteries of penis to relax and allow blood to fill the two corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum of the
penis, making it rigid to prepare for sexual activity. Upon emission of ejaculate, the sympathetics participate
and cause peristalsis of the ductus deferens and closure of the internal urethral sphincter to prevent semen
from entering the bladder. At the same time, parasympathetics cause peristalsis of the urethral muscle, and
the pudendal nerve causes contraction of the bulbospongiosus (skeletal muscle is not via PN), to forcibly
emit the semen. During remission the penis becomes flaccid again. In the female, there is erectile tissue
analogous to the male yet less substantial that plays a large role in sexual stimulation. The PN cause release
of secretions in the female that decrease friction. Also in the female, the parasympathetics innervate the
fallopian tubes, which helps peristaltic contractions and movement of the oocyte to the uterus for
implantation. The secretions from the female genital tract aid in sperm migration. The PN (and SN to a
lesser extent) play a significant role in reproduction.[9]
Vascular effects
Sexual activity
Receptors
The parasympathetic nervous system uses chiefly acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter, although
peptides (such as cholecystokinin) can be used.[21][22] The ACh acts on two types of receptors, the
muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Most transmissions occur in two stages: When stimulated,
the preganglionic neuron releases ACh at the ganglion, which acts on nicotinic receptors of postganglionic
neurons. The postganglionic neuron then releases ACh to stimulate the muscarinic receptors of the target
organ.
The five main types of muscarinic receptors:
The M1 muscarinic receptors (CHRM1 (https://www.genenames.org/tools/search/#!/genes?q
uery=CHRM1)) are located in the neural system.
The M2 muscarinic receptors (CHRM2 (https://www.genenames.org/tools/search/#!/genes?q
uery=CHRM2)) are located in the heart, and act to bring the heart back to normal after the
actions of the sympathetic nervous system: slowing down the heart rate, reducing contractile
forces of the atrial cardiac muscle, and reducing conduction velocity of the sinoatrial node
and atrioventricular node. They have a minimal effect on the contractile forces of the
ventricular muscle due to sparse innervation of the ventricles from the parasympathetic
nervous system.
The M3 muscarinic receptors (CHRM3 (https://www.genenames.org/tools/search/#!/genes?q
uery=CHRM3)) are located at many places in the body, such as the endothelial cells of blood
vessels, as well as the lungs causing bronchoconstriction. The net effect of innervated M3
receptors on blood vessels is vasodilation, as acetylcholine causes endothelial cells to
produce nitric oxide, which diffuses to smooth muscle and results in vasodilation. They are
also in the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, which help in increasing intestinal
motility and dilating sphincters. The M3 receptors are also located in many glands that help
to stimulate secretion in salivary glands and other glands of the body. They are also located
on the detrusor muscle and urothelium of the bladder, causing contraction.[23]
The M4 muscarinic receptors: Postganglionic cholinergic nerves, possible CNS effects
The M5 muscarinic receptors: Possible effects on the CNS
In vertebrates, nicotinic receptors are broadly classified into two subtypes based on their primary sites of
expression: muscle-type nicotinic receptors (N1) primarily for somatic motor neurons; and neuronal-type
nicotinic receptors (N2) primarily for autonomic nervous system.[24]
Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to each other. The sympathetic
division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses. The parasympathetic division functions
with actions that do not require immediate reaction. A mnemonic to summarize the functions of the
parasympathetic nervous system is SSLUDD (sexual arousal, salivation, lacrimation, urination, digestion
and defecation).

Relationship to sympathetic nervous system
Clinical significance
The functions promoted by activity in the parasympathetic nervous system are associated with our day-to-
day living. The parasympathetic nervous system promotes digestion and the synthesis of glycogen, and
allows for normal function and behavior.
Parasympathetic action helps in digestion and absorption of food by increasing the activity of the intestinal
musculature, increasing gastric secretion, and relaxing the pyloric sphincter. It is called the ""rest and digest""
division of the ANS.[25]
The parasympathetic nervous system decreases respiration and heart rate and increases digestion.
Stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system results in:
Constriction of pupils
Decreased heart rate and blood pressure
Constriction of bronchial muscles
Increase in digestion
Increased production of saliva and mucus
Increase in urine secretion[26]
The terminology 'Parasympathetic nervous system' was introduced by John Newport Langley in 1921. He
was the first person who put forward the concept of PSNS as the second division of the autonomic nervous
system.[27]

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of two
components that make up the nervous system of bilateral
animals, with the other part being the central nervous system
(CNS). The PNS consists of nerves and ganglia, which lie
outside the brain and the spinal cord.[1] The main function of
the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs,
essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord
and the rest of the body.[2] Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not
protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood-
brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins.[3]
The peripheral nervous system can be divided into the somatic
nervous system and the visceral nervous system. Each of these
have a sensory and a motor division. The visceral motor
division is known as the autonomic nervous system.[4] In the
somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS
with the exceptions of the olfactory nerve and epithelia and the
optic nerve (cranial nerve II) along with the retina, which are
considered parts of the central nervous system based on
developmental origin. The second cranial nerve is not a true
peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon.[5] Cranial
nerve ganglia, as with all ganglia, are part of the PNS.[6] The
autonomic nervous system exerts involuntary control over
smooth muscle and glands.[7] The connection between CNS
and organs allows the system to be in two different functional
states: sympathetic and parasympathetic.
The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic
nervous system, and the autonomic nervous system. The
somatic nervous system is under voluntary control, and
transmits signals from the brain to end organs such as muscles.
The sensory nervous system is part of the somatic nervous
system and transmits signals from senses such as taste and
touch (including fine touch and gross touch) to the spinal cord
and brain. The autonomic nervous system is a ""self-regulating""
Structure
system which influences the function of organs outside voluntary control, such as the heart rate, or the
functions of the digestive system.
The somatic nervous system includes the sensory nervous system and the somatosensory system and
consists of sensory nerves and somatic nerves, and many nerves which hold both functions.
In the head and neck, cranial nerves carry somatosensory data. There are twelve cranial nerves, ten of
which originate from the brainstem, and mainly control the functions of the anatomic structures of the head
with some exceptions. One unique cranial nerve is the vagus nerve, which receives sensory information
from organs in the thorax and abdomen. The other unique cranial nerve is the accessory nerve which is
responsible for innervating the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, neither of which are located
exclusively in the head.
For the rest of the body, spinal nerves are responsible for somatosensory information. These arise from the
spinal cord. Usually these arise as a web (""plexus"") of interconnected nerves roots that arrange to form
single nerves. These nerves control the functions of the rest of the body. In humans, there are 31 pairs of
spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal. These nerve roots are named
according to the spinal vertebrata which they are adjacent to. In the cervical region, the spinal nerve roots
come out above the corresponding vertebrae (i.e., nerve root between the skull and 1st cervical vertebrae is
called spinal nerve C1). From the thoracic region to the coccygeal region, the spinal nerve roots come out
below the corresponding vertebrae. This method creates a problem when naming the spinal nerve root
between C7 and T1 (so it is called spinal nerve root C8). In the lumbar and sacral region, the spinal nerve
roots travel within the dural sac and they travel below the level of L2 as the cauda equina.
The first 4 cervical spinal nerves, C1 through C4, split and recombine to produce a variety of nerves that
serve the neck and back of head.
Spinal nerve C1 is called the suboccipital nerve, which provides motor innervation to muscles at the base of
the skull. C2 and C3 form many of the nerves of the neck, providing both sensory and motor control. These
include the greater occipital nerve, which provides sensation to the back of the head, the lesser occipital
nerve, which provides sensation to the area behind the ears, the greater auricular nerve and the lesser
auricular nerve.
The phrenic nerve is a nerve essential for our survival which arises from nerve roots C3, C4 and C5. It
supplies the thoracic diaphragm, enabling breathing. If the spinal cord is transected above C3, then
spontaneous breathing is not possible.

Lumbosacral Plexus
The last four cervical spinal nerves, C5 through C8, and the first thoracic spinal nerve, T1, combine to form
the brachial plexus, or plexus brachialis, a tangled array of nerves, splitting, combining and recombining, to
form the nerves that subserve the upper-limb and upper back. Although the brachial plexus may appear
tangled, it is highly organized and predictable, with little variation between people. See brachial plexus
injuries.
The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves, sacral nerves, and coccygeal nerve form the lumbosacral
plexus, the first lumbar nerve being frequently joined by a branch from the twelfth thoracic. For descriptive
purposes this plexus is usually divided into three parts:
lumbar plexus
sacral plexus
pudendal plexus
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls involuntary
responses to regulate physiological functions.[8] The brain and
spinal cord of the central nervous system are connected with organs
that have smooth muscle, such as the heart, bladder, and other
cardiac, exocrine, and endocrine related organs, by ganglionic neurons.[8] The most notable physiological
effects from autonomic activity are pupil constriction and dilation, and salivation of saliva.[8] The autonomic
nervous system is always activated, but is either in the sympathetic or parasympathetic state.[8] Depending
on the situation, one state can overshadow the other, resulting in a release of different kinds of
neurotransmitters.[8]
The sympathetic system is activated during a ""fight or flight"" situation in which mental stress or physical
danger is encountered.[8] Neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, and epinephrine are released,[8] which
increases heart rate and blood flow in certain areas like muscle, while simultaneously decreasing activities
of non-critical functions for survival, like digestion.[9] The systems are independent to each other, which
allows activation of certain parts of the body, while others remain rested.[9]
Primarily using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) as a mediator, the parasympathetic system allows
the body to function in a ""rest and digest"" state.[9] Consequently, when the parasympathetic system
dominates the body, there are increases in salivation and activities in digestion, while heart rate and other
sympathetic response decrease.[9] Unlike the sympathetic system, humans have some voluntary controls in
the parasympathetic system. The most prominent examples of this control are urination and defecation.[9]

Parasympathetic nervous system
Enteric nervous system
There is a lesser known division of the autonomic nervous system known as the enteric nervous system.[9]
Located only around the digestive tract, this system allows for local control without input from the
sympathetic or the parasympathetic branches, though it can still receive and respond to signals from the rest
of the body.[9] The enteric system is responsible for various functions related to gastrointestinal system.[9]
Diseases of the peripheral nervous system can be specific to one or more nerves, or affect the system as a
whole.
Any peripheral nerve or nerve root can be damaged, called a mononeuropathy. Such injuries can be
because of injury or trauma, or compression. Compression of nerves can occur because of a tumour mass or
injury. Alternatively, if a nerve is in an area with a fixed size it may be trapped if the other components
increase in size, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Common symptoms of carpal
tunnel syndrome include pain and numbness in the thumb, index and middle finger. In peripheral
neuropathy, the function one or more nerves are damaged through a variety of means. Toxic damage may
occur because of diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), alcohol, heavy metals or other toxins; some infections;
autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis.[8] Peripheral neuropathy is
associated with a sensory loss in a ""glove and stocking"" distribution that begins at the peripheral and slowly
progresses upwards, and may also be associated with acute and chronic pain. Peripheral neuropathy is not
just limited to the somatosensory nerves, but the autonomic nervous system too (autonomic neuropathy).[8]

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Prefrontal cortex
In mammalian brain anatomy, the prefrontal cortex
(PFC) covers the front part of the frontal lobe of the
cerebral cortex. It is the association cortex in the frontal
lobe.[2] The PFC contains the Brodmann areas BA8,
BA9, BA10, BA11, BA12, BA13, BA14, BA24,
BA25, BA32, BA44, BA45, BA46, and BA47.[1]
This brain region is involved in a wide range of higher-
order cognitive functions, including speech formation
(Broca's area), gaze (frontal eye fields), working
memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and risk
processing (e.g. ventromedial prefrontal cortex). The
basic activity of this brain region is considered to be
orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance
with internal goals.[3] Many authors have indicated an
integral link between a person's will to live, personality,
and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.[4]
This brain region has been implicated in executive
functions, such as planning, decision making, working
memory, personality expression, moderating social
behavior and controlling certain aspects of speech and
language.[5][6][7][8] Executive function relates to
abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts,
determine good and bad, better and best, same and
different, future consequences of current activities,
working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes,
expectation based on actions, and social ""control"" (the
ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could
lead to socially unacceptable outcomes).
The frontal cortex supports concrete rule learning, with
more anterior regions supporting rule learning at higher
levels of abstraction.[9]
There are three possible ways to define the prefrontal
cortex:
Structure
Definition
as the granular frontal cortex
as the projection zone of the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus
as that part of the frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not evoke movements
The prefrontal cortex has been defined based on cytoarchitectonics by the presence of a cortical granular
layer IV. It is not entirely clear who first used this criterion. Many of the early cytoarchitectonic researchers
restricted the use of the term prefrontal to a much smaller region of cortex including the gyrus rectus and the
gyrus rostralis (Campbell, 1905; G. E. Smith, 1907; Brodmann, 1909; von Economo and Koskinas, 1925).
In 1935, however, Jacobsen used the term prefrontal to distinguish granular prefrontal areas from agranular
motor and premotor areas.[10] In terms of Brodmann areas, the prefrontal cortex traditionally includes areas
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 32, 44, 45, 46, and 47,[1] however, not all of these areas are strictly granular
- 44 is dysgranular, caudal 11 and orbital 47 are agranular.[11] The main problem with this definition is that
it works well only in primates but not in nonprimates, as the latter lack a granular layer IV.[12]
To define the prefrontal cortex as the projection zone of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus builds on
the work of Rose and Woolsey,[13] who showed that this nucleus projects to anterior and ventral parts of the
brain in nonprimates, however, Rose and Woolsey termed this projection zone ""orbitofrontal."" It seems to
have been Akert, who, for the first time in 1964, explicitly suggested that this criterion could be used to
define homologues of the prefrontal cortex in primates and nonprimates.[14] This allowed the establishment
of homologies despite the lack of a granular frontal cortex in nonprimates.
The projection zone definition is still widely accepted today (e.g. Fuster[15]), although its usefulness has
been questioned.[11][16] Modern tract tracing studies have shown that projections of the mediodorsal
nucleus of the thalamus are not restricted to the granular frontal cortex in primates. As a result, it was
suggested to define the prefrontal cortex as the region of cortex that has stronger reciprocal connections
with the mediodorsal nucleus than with any other thalamic nucleus.[12] Uylings et al.[12] acknowledge,
however, that even with the application of this criterion, it might be rather difficult to define the prefrontal
cortex unequivocally.
A third definition of the prefrontal cortex is the area of frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not
lead to observable movements. For example, in 1890 David Ferrier[17] used the term in this sense. One
complication with this definition is that the electrically ""silent"" frontal cortex includes both granular and
non-granular areas.[11]
According to Striedter,[18] the PFC of humans can be delineated into two functionally, morphologically, and
evolutionarily different regions: the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) consisting of:
1. the ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC)
2. the medial prefrontal cortex present in all mammals (MPFC)
and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), consisting of:
Granular frontal cortex
Projection zone
Electrically silent area of frontal cortex
Subdivisions
1. the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC)
2. the ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (VLPFC) present only in
primates.
The LPFC contains the Brodmann
areas BA8, BA9, BA10, BA45,
BA46, and BA47. Some researchers
also include BA44. The vmPFC
contains the Brodmann areas BA12,
BA25, BA32, BA33, BA24, BA11,
BA13, and BA14.

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is composed of the BA8, BA9, BA10, and BA46.[1]
The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is composed of areas BA45, BA47, and BA44.[1]
The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is composed of BA12, BA25, and anterior cingulate
cortex: BA32, BA33, BA24.[1] Within that area is the dorsal nexus, which interconnects many
parts of the brain.[19]
The ventral prefrontal cortex is composed of areas BA11, BA13, and BA14.[1] (Also see
the definition of the orbitofrontal cortex.)
The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex contains BA8, including the frontal eye fields.[1]
The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex contains BA45 which is part of Broca's area.[20] Some
researchers also include BA44 the other part of Broca's area.
The prefrontal cortex is highly interconnected with much of the brain, including extensive connections with
other cortical, subcortical and brain stem sites.[21] The dorsal prefrontal cortex is especially interconnected
with brain regions involved with attention, cognition and action,[22] while the ventral prefrontal cortex
Interconnections
interconnects with brain regions involved with emotion.[23] The prefrontal cortex also receives inputs from
the brainstem arousal systems, and its function is particularly dependent on its neurochemical
environment.[24] Thus, there is coordination between one's state of arousal and mental state.[25] The
interplay between the prefrontal cortex and socioemotional system of the brain is relevant for adolescent
development, as proposed by the Dual Systems Model.
The medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the generation of slow-wave sleep (SWS), and
prefrontal atrophy has been linked to decreases in SWS.[26] Prefrontal atrophy occurs naturally as
individuals age, and it has been demonstrated that older adults experience impairments in memory
consolidation as their medial prefrontal cortices degrade.[26] In older adults, instead of being transferred and
stored in the neocortex during SWS, memories start to remain in the hippocampus where they were
encoded, as evidenced by increased hippocampal activation compared to younger adults during recall tasks,
when subjects learned word associations, slept, and then were asked to recall the learned words.[26]
The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) has been implicated in various aspects of speech production
and language comprehension. The VLPFC is richly connected to various regions of the brain including the
lateral and medial temporal lobe, the superior temporal cortex, the infertemporal cortex, the perirhinal
cortex, and the parahippoccampal cortex.[27] These brain areas are implicated in memory retrieval and
consolidation, language processing, and association of emotions. These connections allow the VLPFC to
mediate explicit and implicit memory retrieval and integrate it with language stimulus to help plan coherent
speech.[28] In other words, choosing the correct words and staying ""on topic"" during conversation come
from the VLPFC.
The original studies of Fuster and of Goldman-Rakic emphasized the fundamental ability of the prefrontal
cortex to represent information not currently in the environment, and the central role of this function in
creating the ""mental sketch pad"". Goldman-Rakic spoke of how this representational knowledge was used
to intelligently guide thought, action, and emotion, including the inhibition of inappropriate thoughts,
distractions, actions, and feelings.[29] In this way, working memory can be seen as fundamental to attention
and behavioral inhibition. Fuster speaks of how this prefrontal ability allows the wedding of past to future,
allowing both cross-temporal and cross-modal associations in the creation of goal-directed, perception-
action cycles.[30] This ability to represent underlies all other higher executive functions.
Shimamura proposed Dynamic Filtering Theory to describe the role of the prefrontal cortex in executive
functions. The prefrontal cortex is presumed to act as a high-level gating or filtering mechanism that
enhances goal-directed activations and inhibits irrelevant activations. This filtering mechanism enables
executive control at various levels of processing, including selecting, maintaining, updating, and rerouting
activations. It has also been used to explain emotional regulation.[31]
Miller and Cohen proposed an Integrative Theory of Prefrontal Cortex Function, that arises from the
original work of Goldman-Rakic and Fuster. The two theorize that ""cognitive control stems from the active
maintenance of patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex that represents goals and means to achieve them.
They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along
Function
Executive function
neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to
perform a given task"".[32] In essence, the two theorize that the prefrontal cortex guides the inputs and
connections, which allows for cognitive control of our actions.
The prefrontal cortex is of significant importance when top-down processing is needed. Top-down
processing by definition is when behavior is guided by internal states or intentions. According to the two,
""The PFC is critical in situations when the mappings between sensory inputs, thoughts, and actions either
are weakly established relative to other existing ones or are rapidly changing"".[32] An example of this can
be portrayed in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Subjects engaging in this task are instructed to
sort cards according to the shape, color, or number of symbols appearing on them. The thought is that any
given card can be associated with a number of actions and no single stimulus-response mapping will work.
Human subjects with PFC damage are able to sort the card in the initial simple tasks, but unable to do so as
the rules of classification change.
Miller and Cohen conclude that the implications of their theory can explain how much of a role the PFC has
in guiding control of cognitive actions. In the researchers' own words, they claim that, ""depending on their
target of influence, representations in the PFC can function variously as attentional templates, rules, or goals
by providing top-down bias signals to other parts of the brain that guide the flow of activity along the
pathways needed to perform a task"".[32]
Experimental data indicate a role for the prefrontal cortex in mediating normal sleep physiology, dreaming
and sleep-deprivation phenomena.[33]
When analyzing and thinking about attributes of other individuals, the medial prefrontal cortex is activated,
however, it is not activated when contemplating the characteristics of inanimate objects.[34]
Studies using fMRI have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), specifically the anterior medial
prefrontal cortex (amPFC), may modulate mimicry behavior. Neuroscientists are suggesting that social
priming influences activity and processing in the amPFC, and that this area of the prefrontal cortex
modulates mimicry responses and behavior.[35]
As of recent, researchers have used neuroimaging techniques to find that along with the basal ganglia, the
prefrontal cortex is involved with learning exemplars, which is part of the exemplar theory, one of the three
main ways our mind categorizes things. The exemplar theory states that we categorize judgements by
comparing it to a similar past experience within our stored memories.[36]
A 2014 meta-analysis by Professor Nicole P.Yuan from the University of Arizona found that larger
prefrontal cortex volume and greater PFC cortical thickness were associated with better executive
performance.[37]
A widely accepted theory regarding the function of the brain's prefrontal cortex is that it serves as a store of
short-term memory. This idea was first formulated by Jacobsen, who reported in 1936 that damage to the
primate prefrontal cortex caused short-term memory deficits.[39] Karl Pribram and colleagues (1952)
identified the part of the prefrontal cortex responsible for this deficit as area 46, also known as the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).[40] More recently, Goldman-Rakic and colleagues (1993) evoked
short-term memory loss in localized regions of space by temporary inactivation of portions of the dlPFC.[41]
Attention and memory
Lebedev et al. experiment that dissociated representation of spatial attention from representation of
spatial memory in prefrontal cortex [38]
Once
the
concept of working memory (see also Baddeley's model of working memory) was established in
contemporary neuroscience by Alan Baddeley (1986), these neuropsychological findings contributed to the
theory that the prefrontal cortex implements working memory and, in some extreme formulations, only
working memory.[42] In the 1990s this theory developed a wide following, and it became the predominant
theory of PF function, especially for nonhuman primates. The concept of working memory used by
proponents of this theory focused mostly on the short-term maintenance of information, and rather less on
the manipulation or monitoring of such information or on the use of that information for decisions.
Consistent with the idea that the prefrontal cortex functions predominantly in maintenance memory, delay-
period activity in the PF has often been interpreted as a memory trace. (The phrase ""delay-period activity""
applies to neuronal activity that follows the transient presentation of an instruction cue and persists until a
subsequent ""go"" or ""trigger"" signal.)
To explore alternative interpretations of delay-period activity in the prefrontal cortex, Lebedev et al. (2004)
investigated the discharge rates of single prefrontal neurons as monkeys attended to a stimulus marking one
location while remembering a different, unmarked location.[38] Both locations served as potential targets of
a saccadic eye movement. Although the task made intensive demands on short-term memory, the largest
proportion of prefrontal neurons represented attended locations, not remembered ones. These findings
showed that short-term memory functions cannot account for all, or even most, delay-period activity in the
part of the prefrontal cortex explored. The authors suggested that prefrontal activity during the delay-period
contributes more to the process of attentional selection (and selective attention) than to memory
storage.[8][43]
Various areas of the prefrontal cortex have been implicated in a multitude of critical functions regarding
speech production, language comprehension, and response planning before speaking.[7] Cognitive
neuroscience has shown that the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is vital in the processing of words and
sentences.
Speech production and language
The right prefrontal cortex has been found to be responsible for coordinating the retrieval of explicit
memory for use in speech, whereas the deactivation of the left is responsible for mediating implicit memory
retrieval to be used in verb generation.[7] Recollection of nouns (explicit memory) is impaired in some
amnesic patients with damaged right prefrontal cortices, but verb generation remains intact because of its
reliance on left prefrontal deactivation.[28]
Many researchers now include BA45 in the prefrontal cortex because together with BA44 it makes up an
area of the frontal lobe called Broca's area.[20] Broca's Area is widely considered the output area of the
language production pathway in the brain (as opposed to Wernicke's area in the medial temporal lobe,
which is seen as the language input area). BA45 has been shown to be implicated for the retrieval of
relevant semantic knowledge to be used in conversation/speech.[7] The right lateral prefrontal cortex
(RLPFC) is implicated in the planning of complex behavior, and together with bilateral BA45, they act to
maintain focus and coherence during speech production.[28] However, left BA45 has been shown to be
activated significantly while maintaining speech coherence in young people. Older people have been shown
to recruit the right BA45 more so than their younger counterparts.[28] This aligns with the evidence of
decreased lateralization in other brain systems during aging.
In addition, this increase in BA45 and RLPFC activity in combination of BA47 in older patients has been
shown to contribute to ""off-topic utterances."" The BA47 area in the prefrontal cortex is implicated in
""stimulus-driven"" retrieval of less-salient knowledge than is required to contribute to a conversation.[28] In
other words, elevated activation of the BA47 together with altered activity in BA45 and the broader
RLPFC has been shown to contribute to the inclusion of less relevant information and irrelevant tangential
conversational speech patterns in older subjects.
In the last few decades, brain imaging systems have been used to determine brain region volumes and nerve
linkages. Several studies have indicated that reduced volume and interconnections of the frontal lobes with
other brain regions is observed in patients diagnosed with mental disorders; those subjected to repeated
stressors;[44] those who excessively consume sexually explicit materials;[45] suicides;[46] criminals;
sociopaths; those affected by lead poisoning;[47] It is believed that at least some of the human abilities to
feel guilt or remorse, and to interpret reality, are dependent on a well-functioning prefrontal cortex.[48] The
advanced neurocircuitry and self-regulatory function of the human prefrontal cortex is also associated with
the higher sentience in humans,[49] as the prefrontal cortex in humans occupies a far larger percentage of
the brain than in any other animal. It is theorized that, as the brain has tripled in size over five million years
of human evolution,[50] the prefrontal cortex has increased in size sixfold.[51]
A review on executive functions in healthy exercising individuals noted that the left and right halves of the
prefrontal cortex, which is divided by the medial longitudinal fissure, appears to become more
interconnected in response to consistent aerobic exercise.[52] Two reviews of structural neuroimaging
research indicate that marked improvements in prefrontal and hippocampal gray matter volume occur in
healthy adults that engage in medium intensity exercise for several months.[53][54]
Clinical significance
Chronic intake of alcohol leads to persistent alterations in brain function including altered decision-making
ability. The prefrontal cortex of chronic alcoholics has been shown to be vulnerable to oxidative DNA
damage and neuronal cell death.[55]
Perhaps the seminal case in prefrontal cortex function is that of Phineas Gage, whose left frontal lobe was
destroyed when a large iron rod was driven through his head in an 1848 accident. The standard presentation
is that, although Gage retained normal memory, speech and motor skills, his personality changed radically:
He became irritable, quick-tempered, and impatient--characteristics he did not previously display -- so that
friends described him as ""no longer Gage""; and, whereas he had previously been a capable and efficient
worker, afterward he was unable to complete.[56] However, careful analysis of primary evidence shows that
descriptions of Gage's psychological changes are usually exaggerated when held against the description
given by Gage's doctor, the most striking feature being that changes described years after Gage's death are
far more dramatic than anything reported while he was alive.[57][58]
Subsequent studies on patients with prefrontal injuries have shown that the patients verbalized what the
most appropriate social responses would be under certain circumstances. Yet, when actually performing,
they instead pursued behavior aimed at immediate gratification, despite knowing the longer-term results
would be self-defeating.
The interpretation of this data indicates that not only are skills of comparison and understanding of eventual
outcomes harbored in the prefrontal cortex but the prefrontal cortex (when functioning correctly) controls
the mental option to delay immediate gratification for a better or more rewarding longer-term gratification
result. This ability to wait for a reward is one of the key pieces that define optimal executive function of the
human brain.
There is much current research devoted to understanding the role of the prefrontal cortex in neurological
disorders. Clinical trials have begun on certain drugs that have been shown to improve prefrontal cortex
function, including guanfacine, which acts through the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor. A downstream target
of this drug, the HCN channel, is one of the most recent areas of exploration in prefrontal cortex
pharmacology.[59]
History
Etymology
The term ""prefrontal"" as describing a part of the brain appears to have been introduced by Richard Owen in
1868.[10] For him, the prefrontal area was restricted to the anterior-most part of the frontal lobe
(approximately corresponding to the frontal pole). It has been hypothesized that his choice of the term was
based on the prefrontal bone present in most amphibians and reptiles.[10]

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Schwann cell
Schwann cells or neurolemmocytes (named after German
physiologist Theodor Schwann) are the principal glia of the
peripheral nervous system (PNS). Glial cells function to support
neurons and in the PNS, also include satellite cells, olfactory
ensheathing cells, enteric glia and glia that reside at sensory
nerve endings, such as the Pacinian corpuscle. The two types of
Schwann cells are myelinating and nonmyelinating.[1]
Myelinating Schwann cells wrap around axons of motor and
sensory neurons to form the myelin sheath. The Schwann cell
promoter is present in the downstream region of the human
dystrophin gene that gives shortened transcript that are again
synthesized in a tissue-specific manner.
During the development of the PNS, the regulatory
mechanisms of myelination are controlled by feedforward
interaction of specific genes, influencing transcriptional
cascades and shaping the morphology of the myelinated nerve
fibers.[2]
Schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of
peripheral nerve biology--the conduction of nervous impulses
along axons, nerve development and regeneration, trophic
support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular matrix, modulation of neuromuscular synaptic
activity, and presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
disease, 
Guillain-Barre 
syndrome 
(acute 
inflammatory 
demyelinating
polyradiculopathy type), schwannomatosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and
leprosy are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.
Schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres (both myelinated and
unmyelinated) alive. In myelinated axons, Schwann cells form the myelin sheath. The sheath is not
continuous. Individual myelinating Schwann cells cover about 1 mm of an axon[3]--equating to about 1000
Schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon. The gaps between adjacent Schwann cells are called nodes
of Ranvier.
9-O-Acetyl GD3 ganglioside is an acetylated glycolipid which is found in the cell membranes of many
types of vertebrate cells. During peripheral nerve regeneration, 9-O-acetyl GD3 is expressed by Schwann
cells.[4]
Structure
Function
Schwann cells wrapped around an axon
The vertebrate nervous system relies
on the myelin sheath for insulation and
as a method of decreasing membrane
capacitance in the axon. The action
potential jumps from node to node, in a
process called saltatory conduction,
which can increase conduction velocity
up to 10 times, without an increase in
axonal 
diameter. 
In 
this 
sense,
Schwann cells are the PNS's analogues
of 
the 
central 
nervous 
system's
oligodendrocytes. 
However, 
unlike
oligodendrocytes, 
each 
myelinating
Schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon (see image). This arrangement permits saltatory
conduction of action potentials with repropagation at the nodes of Ranvier. In this way, myelination greatly
increases speed of conduction and saves energy.[5]
Nonmyelinating Schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival.
Some group around smaller axons (External image here (http://www.liv.ac.uk/~rbj/RBJ/rbjteaching/Schwan
n%20Cells.htm)) and form Remak bundles.
Myelinating Schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work
by spiraling around the axon, sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions. A well-developed Schwann cell
is shaped like a rolled-up sheet of paper, with layers of myelin between each coil. The inner layers of the
wrapping, which are predominantly membrane material, form the myelin sheath, while the outermost layer
of nucleated cytoplasm forms the neurilemma. Only a small volume of residual cytoplasm allows
communication between the inner and outer layers. This is seen histologically as the Schmidt-Lantermann
incisure.
Schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration.[6] Nerves in the PNS consist of
many axons myelinated by Schwann cells. If damage occurs to a nerve, the Schwann cells aid in digestion
of its axons (phagocytosis). Following this process, the Schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a
type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons. This tunnel is known as band of Bungner, a guidance
track for the regenerating axons, which behaves like an endoneural tube. The stump of the damaged axon is
able to sprout, and those sprouts that grow through the Schwann-cell ""tunnel"" do so at the rate around
1  mm/day in good conditions. The rate of regeneration decreases with time. Successful axons can,
therefore, reconnect with the muscles or organs they previously controlled with the help of Schwann cells,
but specificity is not maintained and errors are frequent, especially when long distances are involved.[7]
Because of their ability to impact regeneration of axons, Schwann cells have been connected to preferential
motor reinnervation, as well. If Schwann cells are prevented from associating with axons, the axons die.
Regenerating axons will not reach any target unless Schwann cells are there to support them and guide
them. They have been shown to be in advance of the growth cones.

Schwann cells are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons. They produce a variety of factors,
including neurotrophins, and also transfer essential molecules across to axons.
SOX10 is a transcription factor active during embryonic development and
abundant evidence indicates that it is essential for the generation of glial
lineages from trunk crest cells.[8][9] When SOX10 is inactivated in mice,
satellite glia and Schwann cell precursors fail to develop, though neurons are
generated normally without issue.[8] In the absence of SOX10, neural crest
cells survive and are free to generate neurons, but glial specification is
blocked.[9] SOX10 might influence early glial precursors to respond to
neuregulin 1[8] (see below).
Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) acts in a number of ways to both promote the formation
and ensure the survival of immature Schwann cells.[10] During embryonic
development, NRG1 inhibits the formation of neurons from neural crest cells,
instead contributing to neural crest cells being led down a path to gliogenesis.
NRG1 signaling is not, however, required for glial differentiation from the
neural crest.[11]
NRG1 plays important roles in the development of neural crest derivatives. It is required for neural crest
cells to migrate past the site of dorsal root ganglia to find the ventral regions of sympathetic
gangliogenesis.[12] It is also an essential axon-derived survival factor and a mitogen for Schwann cell
precursors.[13] It is found in the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons at the point in time that Schwann
cell precursors begin to populate spinal nerves and therefore influences Schwann cell survival.[11] In
embryonic nerves, the transmembrane III isoform likely is the primary variant of NRG1 responsible for
survival signals. In mice that lack the transmembrane III isoform, Schwann cell precursors are eventually
eliminated from spinal nerves.[14]
Myelin protein zero (P0) is a cell-adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is
the major component of peripheral myelin, constituting over 50% of the total protein in the sheath.[15][16]
P0 has been shown to be essential for the formation of compact myelin, as P0 null mutant (P0-) mice
showed severely aberrant peripheral myelination.[17] Although myelination of large caliber axons was
initiated in P0- mice, the resulting myelin layers were very thin and poorly compacted. Unexpectedly, P0-
mice also showed degeneration of both axons and their surround myelin sheaths, suggesting that P0 plays a

role in maintaining the structural integrity of both myelin formation and the axon with which it is associated.
P0- mice developed behavioral deficits around 2 weeks of age when mice began to show signs of slight
trembling. Gross incoordination also arose as the animals developed, while trembling became more severe
and some older mice developed convulsing behaviors. Despite the array of impaired motor behavior, no
paralysis was observed in these animals. P0 is also an important gene expressed early within the Schwann
cell lineage, expressed in Schwann cell precursors after differentiating from migrating neural crest cells
within the developing embryo.[18]
Several important transcription factors are also expressed and involved at various stages in development
changing the features on the Schwann cells from an immature to mature state. One indispensable
transcription factor expressed during the myelination process is Krox-20. It is a general zinc-finger
transcription factor and is expressed in the rhombomeres 3 and 5.
Krox-20 is considered one of the master regulators of PNS myelination and is important in driving
transcription of specific structural proteins in the myelin. It has been shown to control a set of genes
responsible for interfering with this feature in the axon changing it from a pro-myelinating to myelinating
state.[19] In this way, in Krox-20 double knock out mice, it has been recorded that hindbrain segmentation is
affected as well as myelination of Schwann cell associated axons. Indeed, in these mice, the Schwann cells
are not able to perform their myelination properly as they only wrap their cytoplasmic processes one and
half turn around the axon and despite the fact that they still express the early myelin marker, late myelin
gene products are absent. In addition, recent studies have also proven the importance of this transcription
factor in maintaining the myelination phenotype (and requires the co-expression of Sox 10) as its
inactivation leads to dedifferentiation of the Schwann cells.[2]
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS, acute inflammatory demyelinating
polyradiculopathy type), schwannomatosis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
(CIDP), leprosy, and Zika Virus are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.[20]
A number of experimental studies since 2001 have implanted Schwann cells in an attempt to induce
remyelination in multiple sclerosis-afflicted patients.[21] In the past two decades, many studies have
demonstrated positive results and potential for Schwann cell transplantation as a therapy for spinal cord
injury, both in aiding regrowth and myelination of damaged CNS axons.[22] Schwann cell transplants in
combination with other therapies such as Chondroitinase ABC have also been shown to be effective in
functional recovery from spinal cord injury.[23]

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Sensory nerve
A sensory nerve, or afferent nerve, is an anatomic term for a
nerve that contains exclusively afferent nerve fibers.[1] Nerves
containing also motor fibers are called mixed. Afferent nerve fibers
in a sensory nerve carry sensory information toward the central
nervous system (CNS) from different sensory receptors of sensory
neurons in the peripheral nervous system.
A motor nerve carries information from the CNS to the PNS.
Afferent nerve fibers link the sensory neurons throughout the body,
in pathways to the relevant processing circuits in the central
nervous system.[2]
Afferent nerve fibers are often paired with efferent nerve fibers
from the motor neurons (that travel from the CNS to the PNS), in
mixed nerves. Stimuli cause nerve impulses in the receptors and
alter the potentials, which is known as sensory transduction.[3]
Afferent nerve fibers leave the sensory neuron from the dorsal root
ganglia of the spinal cord, and motor commands carried by the efferent fibers leave the cord at the ventral
roots. The dorsal and some of the ventral fibers join as spinal nerves or mixed nerves.
Damage to the sensory nerve causes a wide range of symptoms because of the number of functions
performed by the nerve. Traumatic injuries and other damages to the sensory nerves may lead to peripheral
neuropathy, with problems such as reduced position sense causing poorer coordination and balance, in
addition to reduced sensitivity to temperature change and pain, leading to further problems.
The ability to feel pain or changes in temperature can be affected by damage to the fibers in the sensory
nerve. This can cause a failure to notice injuries such as a cut or that a wound is becoming infected. There
may also be a lack of detection of heart attacks or other serious conditions. The lack of detection of pain and
other sensations is a particularly large problem for those with diabetes, which contributes to the rate of
lower limb amputations among this population. Overall, the poor sensation and detection may lead to
changes in skin, hair, joint, and bone damage over the years for many people.

Soma (biology)
In cellular neuroscience, the soma (pl.:
somata or somas; from Greek soma
(soma) 
'body'), 
perikaryon 
(pl.:
perikarya), neurocyton, or cell body
is the bulbous, non-process portion of a
neuron or other brain cell type,
containing the cell nucleus. Although it
is often used to refer to neurons, it can
also refer to other cell types as well,
including 
astrocytes,[1]
oligodendrocytes,[2] and microglia.[3]
There are many different specialized
types of neurons, and their sizes vary
from as small as about 5 micrometres to over 10 millimetres for some of the smallest and largest neurons of
invertebrates, respectively.
The soma of a neuron (i.e., the main part of the neuron in which the
dendrites branch off of) contains many organelles, including
granules called Nissl granules, which are composed largely of
rough endoplasmic reticulum and free polyribosomes.[4] The cell
nucleus is a key feature of the soma. The nucleus is the source of
most of the RNA that is produced in neurons. In general, most
proteins are produced from mRNAs that do not travel far from the
cell nucleus. This creates a challenge for supplying new proteins to
axon endings that can be a meter or more away from the soma.
Axons contain microtubule-associated motor proteins that transport
protein-containing vesicles between the soma and the synapses at the axon terminals. Such transport of
molecules towards and away from the soma maintains critical cell functions. In case of neurons, the soma
receives a large number of inhibitory synapses,[5] which can regulate the activity of these cells. It has also
been shown that microglial processes constantly monitor neuronal functions through somatic junctions, and
exert neuroprotection when needed.[6]
The axon hillock is a specialized domain of the neuronal cell body from which the axon originates. A high
amount of protein synthesis occurs in this region, as it contains many Nissl granules (which are ribosomes
wrapped in RER) and polyribosomes. Within the axon hillock, materials are sorted as either items that will
enter the axon (like the components of the cytoskeletal architecture of the axon, mitochondria, etc.) or will
remain in the soma. In addition, the axon hillock also has a specialized plasma membrane that contains large
numbers of voltage-gated ion channels, since this is most often the site of action potential initiation and
triggering.[4]

The survival of some sensory neurons depends on axon terminals making contact with sources of survival
factors that prevent apoptosis. The survival factors are neurotrophic factors, including molecules such as
nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF interacts with receptors at axon terminals, and this produces a signal that
must be transported up the length of the axon to the nucleus. A current theory of how such survival signals
are sent from axon endings to the soma includes the idea that NGF receptors are endocytosed from the
surface of axon tips and that such endocytotic vesicles are transported up the axon.[7]
Intermediate filaments are abundant in both perikarya and axonal and dendritic processes and are called
neurofilaments. The neurofilaments become cross linked with certain fixatives and when impregnated with
silver, they form neuro fibrils visible with the light microscope. [8]

Spinal cord
The spinal cord is a long, thin, tubular structure made up of
nervous tissue that extends from the medulla oblongata in the
brainstem to the lumbar region of the vertebral column
(backbone) of vertebrate animals. The center of the spinal cord
is hollow and contains a structure called the central canal,
which contains cerebrospinal fluid. The spinal cord is also
covered by meninges and enclosed by the neural arches.
Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous
system.
In humans, the spinal cord is a continuation of the brainstem
and anatomically begins at the occipital bone, passing out of the
foramen magnum and then enters the spinal canal at the
beginning of the cervical vertebrae. The spinal cord extends
down to between the first and second lumbar vertebrae, where
it tapers to become the caudal equina. The enclosing bony
vertebral column protects the relatively shorter spinal cord. It is
around 45  cm (18  in) long in adult men and around 43  cm
(17 in) long in adult women. The diameter of the spinal cord
ranges from 13 mm (1/2 in) in the cervical and lumbar regions
to 6.4 mm (1/4 in) in the thoracic area.
The spinal cord functions primarily in the transmission of nerve
signals from the motor cortex to the body, and from the afferent
fibers of the sensory neurons to the sensory cortex. It is also a
center for coordinating many reflexes and contains reflex arcs
that can independently control reflexes.[1] It is also the location
of groups of spinal interneurons that make up the neural circuits
known as central pattern generators. These circuits are
responsible for controlling motor instructions for rhythmic
movements such as walking.[2]
The spinal cord is the main pathway for information connecting
the brain and peripheral nervous system.[3][4] Much shorter
than its protecting spinal column, the human spinal cord
originates in the brainstem, passes through the foramen
magnum, and continues through to the conus medullaris near
the second lumbar vertebra before terminating in a fibrous
extension known as the filum terminale.

It is about 45 centimetres (18 inches) long in males and about
43 cm (17 in) in females, ovoid-shaped, and is enlarged in the
cervical and lumbar regions. The cervical enlargement,
stretching from the C5 to T1 vertebrae, is where sensory input
comes from and motor output goes to the arms and trunk. The
lumbar enlargement, located between L1 and S3, handles
sensory input and motor output coming from and going to the
legs.
The 
spinal 
cord 
is
continuous with the caudal
portion of the medulla,
running from the base of the
skull to the body of the first
lumbar vertebra. It does not
run the full length of the
vertebral column in adults.
It is made of 31 segments
from which branch one pair
of sensory nerve roots and
one pair of motor nerve
roots. The nerve roots then
merge 
into 
bilaterally
symmetrical pairs of spinal
nerves. 
The 
peripheral
nervous system is made up
of these spinal roots, nerves, and ganglia.
The dorsal roots are afferent fascicles, receiving sensory
information from the skin, muscles, and visceral organs to be
relayed to the brain. The roots terminate in dorsal root ganglia,
which are composed of the cell bodies of the corresponding
neurons. Ventral roots consist of efferent fibers that arise from motor
neurons whose cell bodies are found in the ventral (or anterior) gray
horns of the spinal cord.[5]
The spinal cord (and brain) are protected by three layers of tissue or
membranes called meninges, that surround the canal. The dura
mater is the outermost layer, and it forms a tough protective coating. Between the dura mater and the
surrounding bone of the vertebrae is a space called the epidural space. The epidural space is filled with
adipose tissue, and it contains a network of blood vessels. The arachnoid mater, the middle protective layer,
is named for its open, spiderweb-like appearance. The space between the arachnoid and the underlying pia
mater is called the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space contains cerebrospinal fluid, which can be
sampled with a lumbar puncture, or ""spinal tap"" procedure. The delicate pia mater, the innermost protective
layer, is tightly associated with the surface of the spinal cord. The cord is stabilized within the dura mater by
the connecting denticulate ligaments, which extend from the enveloping pia mater laterally between the
dorsal and ventral roots. The dural sac ends at the vertebral level of the second sacral vertebra.
In cross-section, the peripheral region of the cord contains neuronal white matter tracts containing sensory
and motor axons. Internal to this peripheral region is the grey matter, which contains the nerve cell bodies
arranged in the three grey columns that give the region its butterfly-shape. This central region surrounds the
central canal, which is an extension of the fourth ventricle and contains cerebrospinal fluid.
The spinal cord is elliptical in cross section, being compressed dorsolaterally. Two prominent grooves, or
sulci, run along its length. The posterior median sulcus is the groove in the dorsal side, and the anterior
median fissure is the groove in the ventral side.
The human spinal cord is divided into segments where pairs of spinal nerves (mixed; sensory and motor)
form. Six to eight motor nerve rootlets branch out of right and left ventralateral sulci in a very orderly
manner. Nerve rootlets combine to form nerve roots. Likewise, sensory nerve rootlets form off right and left
dorsal lateral sulci and form sensory nerve roots. The ventral (motor) and dorsal (sensory) roots combine to
form spinal nerves (mixed; motor and sensory), one on each side of the spinal cord. Spinal nerves, with the
exception of C1 and C2, form inside the intervertebral foramen. These rootlets form the demarcation
between the central and peripheral nervous systems.
Generally, the spinal cord segments do not correspond to bony vertebra levels. As the spinal cord terminates
at the L1-L2 level, other segments of the spinal cord would be positioned superior to their corresponding
bony vertebral body. For example, the T11 spinal segment is located higher than the T11 bony vertebra, and
the sacral spinal cord segment is higher than the L1 vertebral body.[6]
The grey column, (as three regions of grey columns) in the center of the cord, is shaped like a butterfly and
consists of cell bodies of interneurons, motor neurons, neuroglia cells and unmyelinated axons. The anterior
and posterior grey column present as projections of the grey matter and are also known as the horns of the
spinal cord. Together, the grey columns and the grey commissure form the ""grey H.""
The white matter is located outside of the grey matter and consists almost totally of myelinated motor and
sensory axons. ""Columns"" of white matter carry information either up or down the spinal cord.
The spinal cord proper terminates in a region called the conus medullaris, while the pia mater continues as
an extension called the filum terminale, which anchors the spinal cord to the coccyx. The cauda equina
(""horse's tail"") is a collection of nerves inferior to the conus medullaris that continue to travel through the
vertebral column to the coccyx. The cauda equina forms because the spinal cord stops growing in length at
about age four, even though the vertebral column continues to lengthen until adulthood. This results in
sacral spinal nerves originating in the upper lumbar region. For that reason, the spinal cord occupies only
two-thirds of the vertebral canal. The inferior part of the vertebral canal is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and
the space is called the lumbar cistern.[7]
Within the central nervous system (CNS), nerve cell bodies are generally organized into functional clusters,
called nuclei. Axons within the CNS are grouped into tracts.
There are 31 spinal cord nerve segments in a human spinal cord:
8 cervical segments forming 8 pairs of cervical nerves (C1 spinal nerves exit the spinal
column between the foramen magnum and the C1 vertebra; C2 nerves exit between the

In the fetus, vertebral segments correspond with spinal cord segments. However, because the vertebral
column grows longer than the spinal cord, spinal cord segments do not correspond to vertebral segments in
the adult, particularly in the lower spinal cord. For example, lumbar and sacral spinal cord segments are
found between vertebral levels T9 and L2, and the spinal cord ends around the L1/L2 vertebral level,
forming a structure known as the conus medullaris.
Although the spinal cord cell bodies end around the L1/L2 vertebral level, the spinal nerves for each
segment exit at the level of the corresponding vertebra. For the nerves of the lower spinal cord, this means
that they exit the vertebral column much lower (more caudally) than their roots. As these nerves travel from
their respective roots to their point of exit from the vertebral column, the nerves of the lower spinal
segments form a bundle called the cauda equina.
There are two regions where the spinal cord enlarges:
Cervical enlargement - corresponds roughly to the brachial plexus nerves, which innervate
the upper limb. It includes spinal cord segments from about C4 to T1. The vertebral levels of
the enlargement are roughly the same (C4 to T1).
Lumbar enlargement - corresponds to the lumbosacral plexus nerves, which innervate the
lower limb. It comprises the spinal cord segments from L2 to S3 and is found about the
vertebral levels of T9 to T12.
The spinal cord is made from part of the neural tube during development. There
are four stages of the spinal cord that arises from the neural tube: The neural plate,
neural fold, neural tube, and the spinal cord. Neural differentiation occurs within
the spinal cord portion of the tube.[10] As the neural tube begins to develop, the
notochord begins to secrete a factor known as Sonic hedgehog (SHH). As a
result, the floor plate then also begins to secrete SHH, and this will induce the
basal plate to develop motor neurons. During the maturation of the neural tube, its
lateral walls thicken and form a longitudinal groove called the sulcus limitans.
This extends the length of the spinal cord into dorsal and ventral portions as
well.[11] Meanwhile, the overlying ectoderm secretes bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). This induces the
roof plate to begin to secrete BMP, which will induce the alar plate to develop sensory neurons. Opposing
gradients of such morphogens as BMP and SHH form different domains of dividing cells along the dorsal
ventral axis.[12] Dorsal root ganglion neurons differentiate from neural crest progenitors. As the dorsal and
Development

month old fetus
ventral column cells proliferate, the lumen of the neural tube narrows to form the
small central canal of the spinal cord.[13] The alar plate and the basal plate are
separated by the sulcus limitans. Additionally, the floor plate also secretes netrins.
The netrins act as chemoattractants to decussation of pain and temperature sensory
neurons in the alar plate across the anterior white commissure, where they then
ascend towards the thalamus. Following the closure of the caudal neuropore and
formation of the brain's ventricles that contain the choroid plexus tissue, the
central canal of the caudal spinal cord is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.
Earlier findings by Viktor Hamburger and Rita Levi-Montalcini in the chick
embryo have been confirmed by more recent studies which have demonstrated that the elimination of
neuronal cells by programmed cell death is necessary for the correct assembly of the nervous system.[14]
Overall, spontaneous embryonic activity has been shown to play a role in neuron and muscle development
but is probably not involved in the initial formation of connections between spinal neurons.
The spinal cord is supplied with blood by three arteries that run along its length starting in the brain, and
many arteries that approach it through the sides of the spinal column. The three longitudinal arteries are the
anterior spinal artery, and the right and left posterior spinal arteries.[15] These travel in the subarachnoid
space and send branches into the spinal cord. They form anastomoses (connections) via the anterior and
posterior segmental medullary arteries, which enter the spinal cord at various points along its length.[15] The
actual blood flow caudally through these arteries, derived from the posterior cerebral circulation, is
inadequate to maintain the spinal cord beyond the cervical segments.
The major contribution to the arterial blood supply of the spinal cord below the cervical region comes from
the radially arranged posterior and anterior radicular arteries, which run into the spinal cord alongside the
dorsal and ventral nerve roots, but with one exception do not connect directly with any of the three
longitudinal arteries.[15] These intercostal and lumbar radicular arteries arise from the aorta, provide major
anastomoses and supplement the blood flow to the spinal cord. In humans the largest of the anterior
radicular arteries is known as the artery of Adamkiewicz, or anterior radicularis magna (ARM) artery, which
usually arises between L1 and L2, but can arise anywhere from T9 to L5.[16] Impaired blood flow through
these critical radicular arteries, especially during surgical procedures that involve abrupt disruption of blood
flow through the aorta for example during aortic aneurysm repair, can result in spinal cord infarction and
paraplegia.
In the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract, a primary neuron's axon enters the spinal cord and then enters
the dorsal column. Here the dorsal column connects to the axon of the nerve cell. If the primary axon enters
below spinal level T6, the axon travels in the gracile fasciculus, the medial part of the column. If the axon
enters above level T6, then it travels in the cuneate fasciculus, which is lateral to the fasciculus gracilis.
Either way, the primary axon ascends to the lower medulla, where it leaves its fasciculus and synapses with
Blood supply
Function
Somatosensory organization
Spinal cord tracts
a secondary neuron in one of the dorsal
column nuclei: either the nucleus gracilis or the
nucleus cuneatus, depending on the pathway it
took. At this point, the secondary axon leaves
its nucleus and passes anteriorly and medially.
The collection of secondary axons that do this
are known as internal arcuate fibers. The
internal arcuate fibers decussate and continue
ascending 
as 
the 
contralateral 
medial
lemniscus. Secondary axons from the medial
lemniscus finally terminate in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLN) of the thalamus, where they
synapse with tertiary neurons. From there, tertiary neurons ascend via the posterior limb of the internal
capsule and end in the primary sensory cortex.
The proprioception of the lower limbs differs from the upper limbs and upper trunk. There is a four-neuron
pathway for lower limb proprioception. This pathway initially follows the dorsal spino-cerebellar pathway.
It is arranged as follows: proprioceptive receptors of lower limb  -  peripheral process  -  dorsal root
ganglion - central process - Clarke's column - 2nd order neuron - spinocerebellar tract -cerebellum.
The anterolateral system works somewhat differently. Its primary neurons axons enter the spinal cord and
then ascend one to two levels before synapsing in the substantia gelatinosa. The tract that ascends before
synapsing is known as Lissauer's tract. After synapsing, secondary axons decussate and ascend in the
anterior lateral portion of the spinal cord as the spinothalamic tract. This tract ascends all the way to the
VPLN, where it synapses on tertiary neurons. Tertiary neuronal axons then travel to the primary sensory
cortex via the posterior limb of the internal capsule.
Some of the ""pain fibers"" in the ALS deviate from their pathway towards the VPLN. In one such deviation,
axons travel towards the reticular formation in the midbrain. The reticular formation then projects to a
number of places including the hippocampus (to create memories about the pain), the centromedian nucleus
(to cause diffuse, non-specific pain) and various parts of the cortex. Additionally, some ALS axons project
to the periaqueductal gray in the pons, and the axons forming the periaqueductal gray then project to the
nucleus raphes magnus, which projects back down to where the pain signal is coming from and inhibits it.
This helps control the sensation of pain to some degree..
The corticospinal tract serves as the motor pathway for upper motor neuronal signals coming from the
cerebral cortex and from primitive brainstem motor nuclei.
Cortical upper motor neurons originate from Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 and then descend in the
posterior limb of the internal capsule, through the crus cerebri, down through the pons, and to the medullary
pyramids, where about 90% of the axons cross to the contralateral side at the decussation of the pyramids.
They then descend as the lateral corticospinal tract. These axons synapse with lower motor neurons in the
ventral horns of all levels of the spinal cord. The remaining 10% of axons descend on the ipsilateral side as
the ventral corticospinal tract. These axons also synapse with lower motor neurons in the ventral horns.
Most of them will cross to the contralateral side of the cord (via the anterior white commissure) right before
synapsing.

The midbrain nuclei include four motor tracts that send
upper motor neuronal axons down the spinal cord to lower
motor neurons. These are the rubrospinal tract, the
vestibulospinal tract, the tectospinal tract and the
reticulospinal tract. The rubrospinal tract descends with the
lateral corticospinal tract, and the remaining three descend
with the anterior corticospinal tract.
The function of lower motor neurons can be divided into
two different groups: the lateral corticospinal tract and the
anterior cortical spinal tract. The lateral tract contains upper
motor neuronal axons which synapse on dorsal lateral (DL)
lower motor neurons. The DL neurons are involved in distal
limb control. Therefore, these DL neurons are found
specifically 
only 
in 
the 
cervical 
and 
lumbosacral
enlargements within the spinal cord. There is no decussation
in the lateral corticospinal tract after the decussation at the
medullary pyramids.
The anterior corticospinal tract descends ipsilaterally in the
anterior column, where the axons emerge and either
synapse on lower ventromedial (VM) motor neurons in the
ventral horn ipsilaterally or descussate at the anterior white
commissure where they synapse on VM lower motor
neurons contralaterally. The tectospinal, vestibulospinal and
reticulospinal descend ipsilaterally in the anterior column
but do not synapse across the anterior white commissure.
Rather, they only synapse on VM lower motor neurons
ipsilaterally. The VM lower motor neurons control the large, postural muscles of the axial skeleton. These
lower motor neurons, unlike those of the DL, are located in the ventral horn all the way throughout the
spinal cord.
Proprioceptive information in the body travels up the spinal cord via three tracks. Below L2, the
proprioceptive information travels up the spinal cord in the ventral spinocerebellar tract. Also known as the
anterior spinocerebellar tract, sensory receptors take in the information and travel into the spinal cord. The
cell bodies of these primary neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia. In the spinal cord, the axons
synapse and the secondary neuronal axons decussates and then travel up to the superior cerebellar peduncle
where they decussate again. From here, the information is brought to deep nuclei of the cerebellum
including the fastigial and interposed nuclei.
From the levels of L2 to T1, proprioceptive information enters the spinal cord and ascends ipsilaterally,
where it synapses in Clarke's nucleus. The secondary neuronal axons continue to ascend ipsilaterally and
then pass into the cerebellum via the inferior cerebellar peduncle. This tract is known as the dorsal
spinocerebellar tract.
Spinocerebellar tracts
From above T1, proprioceptive primary axons enter the spinal cord and ascend ipsilaterally until reaching
the accessory cuneate nucleus, where they synapse. The secondary axons pass into the cerebellum via the
inferior cerebellar peduncle where again, these axons synapse on cerebellar deep nuclei. This tract is known
as the cuneocerebellar tract.
Motor information travels from the brain down the spinal cord via descending spinal cord tracts.
Descending tracts involve two neurons: the upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron
(LMN).[17] A nerve signal travels down the upper motor neuron until it synapses with the lower motor
neuron in the spinal cord. Then, the lower motor neuron conducts the nerve signal to the spinal root where
efferent nerve fibers carry the motor signal toward the target muscle. The descending tracts are composed of
white matter. There are several descending tracts serving different functions. The corticospinal tracts (lateral
and anterior) are responsible for coordinated limb movements.[17]
A congenital disorder is diastematomyelia in which part of the spinal cord is split usually at the level of the
upper lumbar vertebrae. Sometimes the split can be along the length of the spinal cord.
Spinal cord injuries can be caused by trauma to the spinal column (stretching, bruising, applying pressure,
severing, laceration, etc.). The vertebral bones or intervertebral disks can shatter, causing the spinal cord to
be punctured by a sharp fragment of bone. Usually, victims of spinal cord injuries will suffer loss of feeling
in certain parts of their body. In milder cases, a victim might only suffer loss of hand or foot function. More
severe injuries may result in paraplegia, tetraplegia (also known as quadriplegia), or full body paralysis
below the site of injury to the spinal cord.
Damage to upper motor neuron axons in the spinal cord results in a characteristic pattern of ipsilateral
deficits. These include hyperreflexia, hypertonia and muscle weakness. Lower motor neuronal damage
results in its own characteristic pattern of deficits. Rather than an entire side of deficits, there is a pattern
relating to the myotome affected by the damage. Additionally, lower motor neurons are characterized by
muscle weakness, hypotonia, hyporeflexia and muscle atrophy.
Spinal shock and neurogenic shock can occur from a spinal injury. Spinal shock is usually temporary,
lasting only for 24-48 hours, and is a temporary absence of sensory and motor functions. Neurogenic shock
lasts for weeks and can lead to a loss of muscle tone due to disuse of the muscles below the injured site.
The two areas of the spinal cord most commonly injured are the cervical spine (C1-C7) and the lumbar
spine (L1-L5). (The notation C1, C7, L1, L5 refer to the location of a specific vertebra in either the
cervical, thoracic, or lumbar region of the spine.) Spinal cord injury can also be non-traumatic and caused
by disease (transverse myelitis, polio, spina bifida, Friedreich's ataxia, spinal cord tumor, spinal stenosis
etc.)[18]
Globally, it is expected there are around 40 to 80 cases of spinal cord injury per million population, and
approximately 90% of these cases result from traumatic events.[19]
Clinical significance
Injury
Real or suspected spinal cord injuries need immediate immobilisation including that of the head. Scans will
be needed to assess the injury. A steroid, methylprednisolone, can be of help as can physical therapy and
possibly antioxidants. Treatments need to focus on limiting post-injury cell death, promoting cell
regeneration, and replacing lost cells. Regeneration is facilitated by maintaining electric transmission in
neural elements.
Spinal stenosis at the lumbar region are usually due to disc herniation, hypertrophy of the facet joint and
ligamentum flavum, osteophyte, and spondylolisthesis. An uncommon cause of lumbar spinal stenosis is
spinal epidural lipomatosis, a condition where there is excessive deposit of fat in the epidural space, causing
compression of nerve root and spinal cord. The epidural fat can be seen as low density on CT scan and high
intensity on T2-weighted fast spin echo MRI images.[20]
Spinal tumours can occur in the spinal cord and these can be either inside (intradural) or outside (extradural)
the dura mater.
Stenosis
Tumours
Procedures
The spinal cord ends at the level of vertebrae L1-L2, while the subarachnoid space --the compartment that
contains cerebrospinal fluid-- extends down to the lower border of S2.[18] Lumbar punctures in adults are
usually performed between L3-L5 (cauda equina level) in order to avoid damage to the spinal cord.[18] In
the fetus, the spinal cord extends the full length of the spine and regresses as the body grows.

Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy
Spinal nerve
Typical spinal nerve location
Spinal nerve
A spinal nerve is a mixed nerve, which carries motor, sensory,
and autonomic signals between the spinal cord and the body. In
the human body there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, one on each
side of the vertebral column.[1][2] These are grouped into the
corresponding cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and coccygeal
regions of the spine.[1] There are eight pairs of cervical nerves,
twelve pairs of thoracic nerves, five pairs of lumbar nerves,
five pairs of sacral nerves, and one pair of coccygeal nerves.
The spinal nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system.[1]
Each spinal nerve is a mixed nerve, formed from the
combination of nerve root fibers from its dorsal and ventral
roots. The dorsal root is the afferent sensory root and carries
sensory information to the brain. The ventral root is the efferent
motor root and carries motor information from the brain. The
spinal nerve emerges from the spinal column through an opening
(intervertebral foramen) between adjacent vertebrae. This is true
for all spinal nerves except for the first spinal nerve pair (C1),
which emerges between the occipital bone and the atlas (the first
vertebra).[3] Thus the cervical nerves are numbered by the
vertebra below, except spinal nerve C8, which exists below
vertebra C7 and above vertebra T1. The thoracic, lumbar, and
sacral nerves are then numbered by the vertebra above. In the
case of a lumbarized S1 vertebra (also known as L6) or a
sacralized L5 vertebra, the nerves are typically still counted to
L5 and the next nerve is S1.
Structure

1. Somatic efferent.
2. Somatic afferent.
3,4,5. Sympathetic efferent.
6,7. Autonomic afferent.
Cervical nerves
Outside the vertebral column, the nerve divides into
branches. The dorsal ramus contains nerves that serve
the posterior portions of the trunk carrying visceral
motor, somatic motor, and somatic sensory information
to and from the skin and muscles of the back (epaxial
muscles). The ventral ramus contains nerves that serve
the remaining anterior parts of the trunk and the upper
and lower limbs (hypaxial muscles) carrying visceral
motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and
from the ventrolateral body surface, structures in the
body wall, and the limbs. The meningeal branches
(recurrent meningeal or sinuvertebral nerves) branch
from the spinal nerve and re-enter the intervertebral
foramen to serve the ligaments, dura, blood vessels,
intervertebral discs, facet joints, and periosteum of the
vertebrae. The rami communicantes contain autonomic
nerves that serve visceral functions carrying visceral
motor and sensory information to and from the visceral
organs.
Some anterior rami merge with adjacent anterior rami to form a nerve plexus, a network of interconnecting
nerves. Nerves emerging from a plexus contain fibers from various spinal nerves, which are now carried
together to some target location. The spinal plexuses are the cervical plexus, brachial plexus, lumbar plexus,
the sacral plexus and the much smaller coccygeal plexus.[3]
The cervical nerves are the spinal nerves from the cervical vertebrae
in the cervical segment of the spinal cord. Although there are seven
cervical vertebrae (C1-C7), there are eight cervical nerves C1-C8.
C1-C7 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while C8
emerges below the C7 vertebra. Everywhere else in the spine, the
nerve emerges below the vertebra with the same name.
The posterior distribution includes the suboccipital nerve (C1), the
greater occipital nerve (C2) and the third occipital nerve (C3). The
anterior distribution includes the cervical plexus (C1-C4) and
brachial plexus (C5-T1).
The cervical nerves innervate the sternohyoid, sternothyroid and
omohyoid muscles.
Regional nerves
Cervical nerves
Lumbar plexus and branches
A loop of nerves called ansa cervicalis is part of the cervical plexus.
The thoracic nerves are the twelve spinal nerves emerging from the thoracic vertebrae. Each thoracic nerve
T1-T12 originates from below each corresponding thoracic vertebra. Branches also exit the spine and go
directly to the paravertebral ganglia of the autonomic nervous system where they are involved in the
functions of organs and glands in the head, neck, thorax and abdomen.
The intercostal nerves come from thoracic nerves T1-T11, and run between the ribs. At T2 and T3, further
branches form the intercostobrachial nerve. The subcostal nerve comes from nerve T12, and runs below the
twelfth rib.
The medial branches (ramus medialis) of the posterior branches of the upper six thoracic nerves run
between the semispinalis dorsi and multifidus, which they supply; they then pierce the rhomboid and
trapezius muscles, and reach the skin by the sides of the spinous processes. This sensitive branch is called
the medial cutaneous ramus.
The medial branches of the lower six are distributed chiefly to the multifidus and longissimus dorsi,
occasionally they give off filaments to the skin near the middle line. This sensitive branch is called the
posterior cutaneous ramus.
The lumbar nerves are the five spinal nerves emerging from the
lumbar vertebrae. They are divided into posterior and anterior
divisions.
The medial branches of the posterior divisions of the lumbar nerves
run close to the articular processes of the vertebrae and end in the
multifidus muscle.
The laterals supply the erector spinae muscles.
The upper three give off cutaneous nerves which pierce the
aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi at the lateral border of the erector
spinae muscles, and descend across the posterior part of the iliac
crest to the skin of the buttock, some of their twigs running as far as
the level of the greater trochanter.

Plan of sacral and pudendal

The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves (rami anteriores) increase in size from above downward. They
are joined, near their origins, by gray rami communicantes from the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic
trunk. These rami consist of long, slender branches which accompany the lumbar arteries around the sides
of the vertebral bodies, beneath the psoas major. Their arrangement is somewhat irregular: one ganglion
may give rami to two lumbar nerves, or one lumbar nerve may receive rami from two ganglia.
The first and second, and sometimes the third and fourth lumbar nerves are each connected with the lumbar
part of the sympathetic trunk by a white ramus communicans.
The nerves pass obliquely outward behind the psoas major, or between its fasciculi, distributing filaments to
it and the quadratus lumborum.
The first three and the greater part of the fourth are connected together in this situation by anastomotic
loops, and form the lumbar plexus.
The smaller part of the fourth joins with the fifth to form the lumbosacral trunk, which assists in the
formation of the sacral plexus. The fourth nerve is named the furcal nerve, from the fact that it is subdivided
between the two plexuses.
The sacral nerves are the five pairs of spinal nerves which exit the
sacrum at the lower end of the vertebral column. The roots of these
nerves begin inside the vertebral column at the level of the L1
vertebra, where the cauda equina begins, and then descend into the
sacrum.[4][5]
There are five paired sacral nerves, half of them arising through the
sacrum on the left side and the other half on the right side. Each
nerve emerges in two divisions: one division through the anterior
sacral foramina and the other division through the posterior sacral
foramina.[4]
The nerves divide into branches and the branches from different
nerves join with one another, some of them also joining with lumbar
or coccygeal nerve branches. These anastomoses of nerves form the
sacral plexus and the lumbosacral plexus. The branches of these
plexus give rise to nerves that supply much of the hip, thigh, leg
and foot.[4][6]
The sacral nerves have both afferent and efferent fibers, thus they are responsible for part of the sensory
perception and the movements of the lower extremities of the human body. From the S2, S3 and S4 arise
the pudendal nerve and parasympathetic fibers whose electrical potential supply the descending colon and
rectum, urinary bladder and genital organs. These pathways have both afferent and efferent fibers and, this

way, they are responsible for conduction of sensory information from these pelvic organs to the central
nervous system (CNS) and motor impulses from the CNS to the pelvis that control the movements of these
pelvic organs.[6]
The bilateral coccygeal nerves, Co, are the 31st pair of spinal nerves. It arises from the conus medullaris,
and its ventral ramus helps form the coccygeal plexus. It does not divide into a medial and lateral branch. Its
fibers are distributed to the skin superficial and posterior to the coccyx bone via the anococcygeal nerve of
the coccygeal nerve plexus.
Coccygeal nerves
Function
Spinal plexuses
A spinal plexus is a weblike nerve plexus formed by the anterior nerve roots that branch and merge
repeatedly. The only region that does not have a plexus is the thoracic region. The small cervical plexus is
in the neck, the brachial plexus is in the shoulder, the lumbar plexus is in the lower back, beneath this is the
sacral plexus, and next to the lower sacrum and coccyx is the very small coccygeal plexus.[3]
The muscles that one particular spinal root supplies are that nerve's myotome, and the dermatomes are the
areas of sensory innervation on the skin for each spinal nerve. Lesions of one or more nerve roots result in
typical patterns of neurologic defects (muscle weakness, abnormal sensation, changes in reflexes) that allow
localization of the responsible lesion.
There are several procedures used in sacral nerve stimulation for the treatment of various related disorders.
Sciatica is generally caused by the compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3,

Sympathetic nervous system
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the three
divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the others being the
parasympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous
system.[1][2] The enteric nervous system is sometimes
considered part of the autonomic nervous system, and
sometimes considered an independent system.[3]
The autonomic nervous system functions to regulate the body's
unconscious actions. The sympathetic nervous system's primary
process is to stimulate the body's fight or flight response. It is,
however, constantly active at a basic level to maintain
homeostasis.[4] The sympathetic nervous system is described as
being antagonistic to the parasympathetic nervous system. The
latter stimulates the body to ""feed and breed"" and to (then)
""rest-and-digest"".
The SNS has a major role in various physiological processes
such as blood glucose levels, body temperature, cardiac output,
and immune system function. The formation of sympathetic
neurons being observed at embryonic stage of life and its
development during aging shows its significance in health; its
dysfunction has shown to be linked to various health
disorders.[5]
There are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of
any signal through the sympathetic system: pre-ganglionic and
post-ganglionic. The shorter preganglionic neurons originate in
the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at T1
to L2~L3, and travel to a ganglion, often one of the
paravertebral 
ganglia, 
where 
they 
synapse 
with 
a
postganglionic neuron. From there, the long postganglionic
neurons extend across most of the body.[6]
At the synapses within the ganglia, preganglionic neurons
release acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that activates nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons. In response
to 
this 
stimulus, 
the 
postganglionic 
neurons 
release
norepinephrine, which activates adrenergic receptors that are
present on the peripheral target tissues. The activation of target

plexuses.
tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the
sympathetic system. However, there are three important
exceptions:[7]
1. Postganglionic neurons of sweat glands release
acetylcholine for the activation of muscarinic
receptors, except for areas of thick skin, the palms
and the plantar surfaces of the feet, where
norepinephrine is released and acts on adrenergic
receptors. This leads to the activation of sudomotor function which is assessed by
electrochemical skin conductance.
2. Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are analogous to post-ganglionic neurons; the
adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system and acts as a
modified sympathetic ganglion. Within this endocrine gland, pre-ganglionic neurons synapse
with chromaffin cells, triggering the release of two transmitters: a small proportion of
norepinephrine, and more substantially, epinephrine. The synthesis and release of
epinephrine as opposed to norepinephrine is another distinguishing feature of chromaffin
cells compared to postganglionic sympathetic neurons.[8]
3. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves terminating in the kidney release dopamine, which acts
on dopamine D1 receptors of blood vessels to control how much blood the kidney filters.
Dopamine is the immediate metabolic precursor to norepinephrine, but is nonetheless a
distinct signaling molecule.[9]
Sympathetic nerves arise from near the middle of the spinal cord in
the intermediolateral nucleus of the lateral grey column, beginning
at the first thoracic vertebra of the vertebral column and are thought
to extend to the second or third lumbar vertebra. Because its cells
begin in the thoracolumbar division - the thoracic and lumbar
regions of the spinal cord - the sympathetic nervous system is said
to have a thoracolumbar outflow. Axons of these nerves leave the
spinal cord through the anterior root. They pass near the spinal
(sensory) ganglion, where they enter the anterior rami of the spinal
nerves. However, unlike somatic innervation, they quickly separate
out through white rami connectors (so called from the shiny white
sheaths of myelin around each axon) that connect to either the
paravertebral (which lie near the vertebral column) or prevertebral
(which lie near the aortic bifurcation) ganglia extending alongside
the spinal column.
To reach target organs and glands, the axons must travel long
distances in the body, and, to accomplish this, many axons relay
their message to a second cell through synaptic transmission. The
ends of the axons link across a space, the synapse, to the dendrites
of the second cell. The first cell (the presynaptic cell) sends a
neurotransmitter across the synaptic cleft where it activates the
second cell (the postsynaptic cell). The message is then carried to
the final destination.

Presynaptic nerves' axons terminate in either the paravertebral
ganglia or prevertebral ganglia. There are four different paths an
axon can take before reaching its terminal. In all cases, the axon
enters the paravertebral ganglion at the level of its originating spinal
nerve. After this, it can then either synapse in this ganglion, ascend
to a more superior or descend to a more inferior paravertebral
ganglion and synapse there, or it can descend to a prevertebral
ganglion and synapse there with the postsynaptic cell.[10]
The postsynaptic cell then goes on to innervate the targeted end
effector (i.e. gland, smooth muscle, etc.). Because paravertebral and
prevertebral ganglia are close to the spinal cord, presynaptic
neurons are much shorter than their postsynaptic counterparts,
which must extend throughout the body to reach their destinations.
A notable exception to the routes mentioned above is the
sympathetic innervation of the suprarenal (adrenal) medulla. In this
case, presynaptic neurons pass through paravertebral ganglia, on through prevertebral ganglia and then
synapse directly with suprarenal tissue. This tissue consists of cells that have pseudo-neuron like qualities in
that when activated by the presynaptic neuron, they will release their neurotransmitter (epinephrine) directly
into the bloodstream.
In the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system, these synapses
are made at sites called ganglia. The cell that sends its fiber is called a preganglionic cell, while the cell
whose fiber leaves the ganglion is called a postganglionic cell. As mentioned previously, the preganglionic
cells of the sympathetic nervous system are located between the first thoracic segment and the third lumbar
segments of the spinal cord. Postganglionic cells have their cell bodies in the ganglia and send their axons to
target organs or glands.
The ganglia include not just the sympathetic trunks but also the cervical ganglia (superior, middle and
inferior), which send sympathetic nerve fibers to the head and thorax organs, and the celiac and mesenteric
ganglia, which send sympathetic fibers to the gut.

Messages travel through the sympathetic nervous system in a bi-
directional flow. Efferent messages can trigger changes in different
parts of the body simultaneously. For example, the sympathetic
nervous system can accelerate heart rate; widen bronchial passages;
decrease motility (movement) of the large intestine; constrict blood
vessels; increase peristalsis in the oesophagus; cause pupillary
dilation, piloerection (goose bumps) and perspiration (sweating);
and raise blood pressure. One exception is with certain blood
vessels such as those in the cerebral and coronary arteries, which
dilate (rather than constrict) with an increase in sympathetic tone.
This is because of a proportional increase in the presence of b2
adrenergic receptors rather than a1 receptors. b2 receptors promote vessel dilation instead of constriction
like a1 receptors. An alternative explanation is that the primary (and direct) effect of sympathetic stimulation

on coronary arteries is vasoconstriction followed by a secondary vasodilation caused by the release of
vasodilatory metabolites due to the sympathetically increased cardiac inotropy and heart rate. This
secondary vasodilation caused by the primary vasoconstriction is termed functional sympatholysis, the
overall effect of which on coronary arteries is dilation.[12] The target synapse of the postganglionic neuron
is mediated by adrenergic receptors and is activated by either norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine
(adrenaline).
The sympathetic nervous system is
responsible for up- and down-regulating
many homeostatic mechanisms in living
organisms. Fibers from the SYNS
innervate tissues in almost every organ
system, 
providing 
at 
least 
some
regulation of functions as diverse as
pupil diameter, gut motility, and urinary
system output and function.[15] It is
perhaps best known for mediating the
neuronal and hormonal stress response
commonly known as the fight-or-flight
response. This response is also known
as sympatho-adrenal response of the
body, as the preganglionic sympathetic
fibers that end in the adrenal medulla
(but also all other sympathetic fibers)
secrete acetylcholine, which activates the great secretion of adrenaline (epinephrine) and to a lesser extent
noradrenaline (norepinephrine) from it. Therefore, this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular
system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly
via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla.
The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for priming the body for action, particularly in situations
threatening survival.[16] One example of this priming is in the moments before waking, in which
sympathetic outflow spontaneously increases in preparation for action.
Sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels, including many of
those in the skin, the digestive tract, and the kidneys. This occurs as a result of activation of alpha-1
adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine released by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons. These receptors
exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta-2 adrenergic
receptors (stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands) in the skeletal muscles, the heart, the
lungs, and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response. The net effect of this is a shunting of blood away
from the organs not necessary to the immediate survival of the organism and an increase in blood flow to
those organs involved in intense physical activity.
Function
Sensation
The afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system, which transmit sensory information from the internal
organs of the body back to the central nervous system (or CNS), are not divided into parasympathetic and
sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are.[17] Instead, autonomic sensory information is conducted by
general visceral afferent fibers.
General visceral afferent sensations are mostly unconscious visceral motor reflex sensations from hollow
organs and glands that are transmitted to the CNS. While the unconscious reflex arcs normally are
undetectable, in certain instances they may send pain sensations to the CNS masked as referred pain. If the
peritoneal cavity becomes inflamed or if the bowel is suddenly distended, the body will interpret the afferent
pain stimulus as somatic in origin. This pain is usually non-localized. The pain is also usually referred to
dermatomes that are at the same spinal nerve level as the visceral afferent synapse.
Together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system,
the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body's internal organs. Reaction to stress
--as in the flight-or-fight response--is thought to be elicited by the sympathetic nervous system and to
counteract the parasympathetic system, which works to promote maintenance of the body at rest. The
comprehensive functions of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems are not so
straightforward, but this is a useful rule of thumb.[4][18]
It was originally believed that the sympathetic nervous system arose with jawed vertebrates.[19] However,
the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), a jawless vertebrate, has been found to contain the key building
blocks and developmental controls of a sympathetic nervous system.[20] Nature described this research as a
""landmark study"" that ""point to a remarkable diversification of sympathetic neuron populations among
vertebrate classes and species"".[21]
The dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system is linked to many health disorders, such as heart failure,
gastrointestinal problems, immune dysfunction as well as, metabolic disorders like, hypertension and
diabetes. Highlighting the importance of the sympathetic nervous system for health.
The sympathetic stimulation of metabolic tissues is required for the maintenance of metabolic regulation and
feedback loops. The dysregulation of this system leads to an increased risk of neuropathy within metabolic
tissues and therefore can worsen or precipitate metabolic disorders. An example of this includes the
retraction of sympathetic neurons due to leptin resistance, which is linked to obesity.[22] Another example,
although more research is required, is the observed link that diabetes results in the impairment of synaptic
transmission due to the inhibition of acetylcholine receptors as a result of high blood glucose levels. The
loss of sympathetic neurons is also associated with the reduction of insulin secretion and impaired glucose
tolerance, further exacerbating the disorder.[23]
The sympathetic nervous system holds a major role in long-term regulation of hypertension, whereby the
central nervous system stimulates sympathetic nerve activity in specific target organs or tissues via
neurohumoral signals. In terms of hypertension, the overactivation of the sympathetic system results in
Relationship with the parasympathetic nervous system
Origins
Disorders
vasoconstriction and increased heart rate resulting in increased blood pressure. In turn, increasing the
potential of the development of cardiovascular disease.[24]
In heart failure, the sympathetic nervous system increases its activity, leading to increased force of muscular
contractions that in turn increases the stroke volume, as well as peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain
blood pressure. However, these effects accelerate disease progression, eventually increasing mortality in
heart failure.[25]
Sympathicotonia is a stimulated[26] condition of the sympathetic nervous system, marked by vascular
spasm,[27] elevated blood pressure,[27] and goose bumps.[27]
Heightened sympathetic nervous system activity is also linked to various mental health disorders such as,
anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is suggested that the overactivation of the
SNS results in the increased severity of PTSD symptoms. In accordance with disorders like hypertension
and cardiovascular disease mentioned above, PTSD is also linked with the increased risk of developing
mentioned diseases, further correlating the link between these disorders and the SNS.[28]
The sympathetic nervous system is sensitive to stress, studies suggest that the chronic dysfunction of the
sympathetic system results in migraines, due to the vascular changes associated with tension headaches.
Individuals with migraine attacks are exhibited to have symptoms that are associated with sympathetic
dysfunction, which include reduced levels of plasma norepinephrine levels, sensitivity of the peripheral
adrenergic receptors.[29]
Insomnia is a sleeping disorder, that makes falling or staying asleep difficult, this disruption in sleep results
in sleep deprivation and various symptoms, with the severity depending on whether the insomnia is acute or
chronic. The most favoured hypothesis for the cause of insomnia is the hyperarousal hypothesis, which is
known as a collective over-activation of various systems in the body, this over-activation includes the
hyperactivity of the SNS. Whereby during sleep cycle disruption sympathetic baroreflex function and
neural cardiovascular responses become impaired.[30][31]
However more research is still required, as methods used in measuring SNS biological measures are not so
reliable due to the sensitivity of the SNS, many factors easily effect its activity, like stress, environment,
timing of day, and disease. These factors can impact results significantly and for more accurate results
extremely invasive methods are required, such as microneurography. The difficultly of measuring the SNS
activity does not only apply to insomnia, but also with various disorders previously discussed. However,
overtime with advancements in technology and techniques in research studies the disruption of the SNS and
its impact on the human body will be explored further. [32][33]
The name of this system can be traced to the concept of sympathy, in the sense of ""connection between
parts"", first used medically by Galen.[34] In the 18th century, Jacob B. Winslow applied the term
specifically to nerves.[35]
The concept that an independent part of the nervous system coordinates body functions had its origin in the
works of Galen (129-199), who proposed that nerves distributed spirits throughout the body. From animal
dissections he concluded that there were extensive interconnections from the spinal cord to the viscera and
from one organ to another. He proposed that this system fostered a concerted action or 'sympathy' of the

organs. Little changed until the Renaissance when Bartolomeo Eustacheo (1545) depicted the sympathetic
nerves, the vagus and adrenal glands in anatomical drawings. Jacobus Winslow (1669-1760), a Danish-
born professor working in Paris, popularised the term 'sympathetic nervous system' in 1732 to describe the
chain of ganglia and nerves which were connected to the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord.[36]

Synapse
In the nervous system, a synapse[1] is
a structure that permits a neuron (or
nerve cell) to pass an electrical or
chemical signal to another neuron or to
the target effector cell.
Synapses 
are 
essential 
to 
the
transmission of nervous impulses from
one neuron to another,[2] playing a key
role in enabling rapid and direct
communication by creating circuits. In
addition, a synapse serves as a junction
where both the transmission and
processing 
of 
information 
occur,
making 
it 
a 
vital 
means 
of
communication between neurons.[3] Neurons are specialized to pass signals to individual target cells, and
synapses are the means by which they do so. At a synapse, the plasma membrane of the signal-passing
neuron (the presynaptic neuron) comes into close apposition with the membrane of the target (postsynaptic)
cell. Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic sites contain extensive arrays of molecular machinery that link
the two membranes together and carry out the signaling process. In many synapses, the presynaptic part is
located on an axon and the postsynaptic part is located on a dendrite or soma. Astrocytes also exchange
information with the synaptic neurons, responding to synaptic activity and, in turn, regulating
neurotransmission.[2] Synapses (at least chemical synapses) are stabilized in position by synaptic adhesion
molecules (SAMs) projecting from both the pre- and post-synaptic neuron and sticking together where they
overlap; SAMs may also assist in the generation and functioning of synapses.[4] Moreover, SAMs
coordinate the formation of synapses, with various types working together to achieve the remarkable
specificity of synapses.[3][5] In essence, SAMs function in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, likely
serving as devices for signal transmission.[3]
Santiago Ramon y Cajal proposed that neurons are not continuous throughout the body, yet still
communicate with each other, an idea known as the neuron doctrine.[6] The word ""synapse"" was
introduced in 1897 by the English neurophysiologist Charles Sherrington in Michael Foster's Textbook of
Physiology.[1] Sherrington struggled to find a good term that emphasized a union between two separate
elements, and the actual term ""synapse"" was suggested by the English classical scholar Arthur Woollgar
Verrall, a friend of Foster.[7][8] The word was derived from the Greek synapsis (sunapsis), meaning
""conjunction"", which in turn derives from synaptein (sunaptein), from syn (sun) ""together"" and haptein
(aptein) ""to fasten"".[7][9]
History
An example of chemical synapse by
the release of neurotransmitters like
acetylcholine or glutamic acid.
However, while the synaptic gap remained a theoretical construct, and was sometimes reported as a
discontinuity between contiguous axonal terminations and dendrites or cell bodies, histological methods
using the best light microscopes of the day could not visually resolve their separation which is now known
to be about 20 nm. It needed the electron microscope in the 1950s to show the finer structure of the synapse
with its separate, parallel pre- and postsynaptic membranes and processes, and the cleft between the
two.[10][11][12]
Chemical and electrical synapses are two ways of synaptic
transmission.
In a chemical synapse, electrical activity in the
presynaptic neuron is converted (via the activation of
voltage-gated calcium channels) into the release of a
chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds to receptors
located in the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell.
The neurotransmitter may initiate an electrical response
or a secondary messenger pathway that may either
excite or inhibit the postsynaptic neuron. Chemical
synapses can be classified according to the
neurotransmitter released: glutamatergic (often
excitatory), GABAergic (often inhibitory), cholinergic (e.g.
vertebrate neuromuscular junction), and adrenergic
(releasing norepinephrine). Because of the complexity of receptor signal transduction,
chemical synapses can have complex effects on the postsynaptic cell.
In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell membranes are connected by
special channels called gap junctions that are capable of passing an electric current,
causing voltage changes in the presynaptic cell to induce voltage changes in the
postsynaptic cell.[13][14] In fact, gap junctions facilitate the direct flow of electrical current
without the need for neurotransmitters, as well as small molecules like calcium.[15] Thus, the
main advantage of an electrical synapse is the rapid transfer of signals from one cell to the
next.[13]
Mixed chemical electrical synapses are synaptic sites that feature both a gap junction and
neurotransmitter release.[16][17] This combination allows a signal to have both a fast
component (electrical) and a slow component (chemical).
The formation of neural circuits in nervous systems, appears to heavily depend on the crucial interactions
between chemical and electrical synapses. Thus, these interactions govern the generation of synaptic
transmission.[14] Synaptic communication is distinct from an ephaptic coupling, in which communication
between neurons occurs via indirect electric fields. An autapse is a chemical or electrical synapse that forms
when the axon of one neuron synapses onto dendrites of the same neuron.
1. Excitatory synapse: Enhances the probability of depolarization in postsynaptic neurons and
the initiation of an action potential.
2. Inhibitory Synapse: Diminishes the probability of depolarization in postsynaptic neurons and
the initiation of an action potential.
Types
Excitatory and inhibitory
An influx of Na+ driven by excitatory neurotransmitters opens cation channels, depolarizing the
postsynaptic membrane toward the action potential threshold. In contrast, inhibitory neurotransmitters cause
the postsynaptic membrane to become less depolarized by opening either Cl- or K+ channels, reducing
firing. Depending on their release location, the receptors they bind to, and the ionic circumstances they
encounter, various transmitters can be either excitatory or inhibitory. For instance, acetylcholine can either
excite or inhibit depending on the type of receptors it binds to.[18] For example, glutamate serves as an
excitatory neurotransmitter, in contrast to GABA, which acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Additionally,
dopaminergic is a neurotransmitter that exerts dual effects, displaying both excitatory and inhibitory impacts
through binding to distinct receptors.[19]
The membrane potential prevents Cl- from entering the cell, even when its concentration is much higher
outside than inside. The resting potential for Cl- in many neurons is quite negative, nearly equal to the
resting potential. Opening Cl- channels tends to buffer the membrane potential, but this effect is countered
when the membrane starts to depolarize, allowing more negatively charged Cl- ions to enter the cell.
Consequently, it becomes more difficult to depolarize the membrane and excite the cell when Cl- channels
are open. Similar effects result from the opening of K+ channels. The significance of inhibitory
neurotransmitters is evident from the effects of toxins that impede their activity. For instance, strychnine
binds to glycine receptors, blocking the action of glycine and leading to muscle spasms, convulsions, and
death.[18]
Synapses can be classified by the type of cellular structures serving as the pre- and post-synaptic
components. The vast majority of synapses in the mammalian nervous system are classical axo-dendritic
synapses (axon synapsing upon a dendrite), however, a variety of other arrangements exist. These include
but are not limited to axo-axonic, dendro-dendritic, axo-secretory, axo-ciliary,[20] somato-dendritic, dendro-
somatic, and somato-somatic synapses.
In fact, the axon can synapse onto a dendrite, onto a cell body, or onto another axon or axon terminal, as
well as into the bloodstream or diffusely into the adjacent nervous tissue.
Interfaces
Different types of synapses
Neurotransmitters are tiny signal molecules stored in membrane-enclosed synaptic vesicles and released via
exocytosis. Indeed, a change in electrical potential in the presynaptic cell triggers the release of these
molecules. By attaching to transmitter-gated ion channels, the neurotransmitter causes an electrical alteration
in the postsynaptic cell and rapidly diffuses across the synaptic cleft. Once released, the neurotransmitter is
swiftly eliminated, either by being absorbed by the nerve terminal that produced it, taken up by nearby glial
cells, or broken down by specific enzymes in the synaptic cleft. Numerous Na+-dependent neurotransmitter
carrier proteins recycle the neurotransmitters and enable the cells to maintain rapid rates of release.
At chemical synapses, transmitter-gated ion channels play a vital role in rapidly converting extracellular
chemical impulses into electrical signals. These channels are located in the postsynaptic cell's plasma
membrane at the synapse region, and they temporarily open in response to neurotransmitter molecule
binding, causing a momentary alteration in the membrane's permeability. Additionally, transmitter-gated
channels are comparatively less sensitive to the membrane potential than voltage-gated channels, which is
why they are unable to generate self-amplifying excitement on their own. However, they result in graded
variations in membrane potential due to local permeability, influenced by the amount and duration of
neurotransmitter released at the synapse.[18]
Recently, mechanical tension, a phenomenon never thought relevant to synapse function has been found to
be required for those on hippocampal neurons to fire.[21]
Neurotransmitters bind to ionotropic receptors on postsynaptic neurons, either causing their opening or
closing.[19] The variations in the quantities of neurotransmitters released from the presynaptic neuron may
play a role in regulating the effectiveness of synaptic transmission. In fact, the concentration of cytoplasmic
calcium is involved in regulating the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic neurons.[22]
The chemical transmission involves several sequential processes:
Conversion of chemical into electrical signals
Release of neurotransmitters
1. Synthesizing neurotransmitters within the presynaptic neuron.
2. Loading the neurotransmitters into secretory vesicles.
3. Controlling the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
4. Binding of neurotransmitters to postsynaptic receptors.
5. Ceasing the activity of the released neurotransmitters.[23]
The function of neurons depends upon cell polarity. The distinctive structure of nerve cells allows action
potentials to travel directionally (from dendrites to cell body down the axon), and for these signals to then
be received and carried on by post-synaptic neurons or received by effector cells. Nerve cells have long
been used as models for cellular polarization, and of particular interest are the mechanisms underlying the
polarized localization of synaptic molecules. PIP2 signaling regulated by IMPase plays an integral role in
synaptic polarity.
Phosphoinositides (PIP, PIP2, and PIP3) are molecules that have been shown to affect neuronal
polarity.[24] A gene (ttx-7) was identified in Caenorhabditis elegans that encodes myo-inositol
monophosphatase (IMPase), an enzyme that produces inositol by dephosphorylating inositol phosphate.
Organisms with mutant ttx-7 genes demonstrated behavioral and localization defects, which were rescued
by expression of IMPase. This led to the conclusion that IMPase is required for the correct localization of
synaptic protein components.[25][26] The egl-8 gene encodes a homolog of phospholipase Cb (PLCb), an
enzyme that cleaves PIP2. When ttx-7 mutants also had a mutant egl-8 gene, the defects caused by the
faulty ttx-7 gene were largely reversed. These results suggest that PIP2 signaling establishes polarized
localization of synaptic components in living neurons.[25]
Modulation of neurotransmitter release by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a prominent presynaptic
mechanism for regulation of synaptic transmission. The activation of GPCRs located at the presynaptic
terminal, can decrease the probability of neurotransmitter release. This presynaptic depression involves
activation of Gi/o-type G-proteins that mediate different inhibitory mechanisms, including inhibition of
voltage-gated calcium channels, activation of potassium channels, and direct inhibition of the vesicle fusion
process. Endocannabinoids, synthesized in and released from postsynaptic neuronal elements, and their
cognate receptors, including the (GPCR) CB1 receptor, located at the presynaptic terminal, are involved in
this modulation by a retrograde signaling process, in which these compounds are synthesized in and
released from postsynaptic neuronal elements, and travel back to the presynaptic terminal to act on the CB1
receptor for short-term or long-term synaptic depression, that cause a short or long lasting decrease in
neurotransmitter release.[27]
Drugs have long been considered crucial targets for transmitter-gated ion channels. The majority of
medications utilized to treat schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and sleeplessness work at chemical
synapses, and many of these pharmaceuticals function by binding to transmitter-gated channels. For
instance, some drugs like barbiturates and tranquilizers bind to GABA receptors and enhance the inhibitory
effect of GABA neurotransmitter. Thus, reduced concentration of GABA enables the opening of Cl-
channels.
Synaptic polarization
Presynaptic modulation
Effects of drugs on ligand-gated ion channels
Furthermore, psychoactive drugs could potentially target many other synaptic signalling machinery
components. In fact, numerous neurotransmitters are released by Na+-driven carriers and are subsequently
removed from the synaptic cleft. By inhibiting such carriers, synaptic transmission is strengthened as the
action of the transmitter is prolonged. For example, Prozac is one of antidepressant medications that works
by preventing the absorption of serotonin neurotransmitter. Also, other antidepressants operate by inhibiting
the reabsorption of both serotonin and norepinephrine.[18]
In nerve terminals, synaptic vesicles are produced quickly to compensate for their rapid depletion during
neurotransmitter release. Their biogenesis involves segregating synaptic vesicle membrane proteins from
other cellular proteins and packaging those distinct proteins into vesicles of appropriate size. Besides, it
entails the endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins from the plasma membrane.[28]
Synaptoblastic and synaptoclastic refer to synapse-producing and synapse-removing activities within the
biochemical signalling chain. This terminology is associated with the Bredesen Protocol for treating
Alzheimer's disease, which conceptualizes Alzheimer's as an imbalance between these processes. As of
October 2023, studies concerning this protocol remain small and few results have been obtained within a
standardized control framework.
It is widely accepted that the synapse plays a key role in the formation of memory.[29] The stability of long-
term memory can persist for many years; nevertheless, synapses, the neurological basis of memory, are very
dynamic.[30] The formation of synaptic connections significantly depends on activity-dependent synaptic
plasticity observed in various synaptic pathways. Indeed, the connection between memory formation and
alterations in synaptic efficacy enables the reinforcement of neuronal interactions between neurons. As
neurotransmitters activate receptors across the synaptic cleft, the connection between the two neurons is
strengthened when both neurons are active at the same time, as a result of the receptor's signaling
mechanisms. The strength of two connected neural pathways is thought to result in the storage of
information, resulting in memory. This process of synaptic strengthening is known as long-term potentiation
(LTP).[29]
By altering the release of neurotransmitters, the plasticity of synapses can be controlled in the presynaptic
cell. The postsynaptic cell can be regulated by altering the function and number of its receptors. Changes in
postsynaptic signaling are most commonly associated with a N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-
dependent LTP and long-term depression (LTD) due to the influx of calcium into the post-synaptic cell,
which are the most analyzed forms of plasticity at excitatory synapses.[31]
Moreover, Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is best recognized for its roles in
the brain, particularly in the neocortex and hippocampal regions because it serves as a ubiquitous mediator
of cellular Ca2+ signals. CaMKII is abundant in the nervous system, mainly concentrated in the synapses in

the nerve cells. Indeed, CaMKII has been definitively identified as a key regulator of cognitive processes,
such as learning, and neural plasticity. The first concrete experimental evidence for the long-assumed
function of CaMKII in memory storage was demonstrated
While Ca2+/CaM binding stimulates CaMKII activity, Ca2+-independent autonomous CaMKII activity can
also be produced by a number of other processes. CaMKII becomes active by autophosphorylating itself
upon Ca2+/calmodulin binding. CaMKII is still active and phosphorylates itself even after Ca2+ is cleaved;
as a result, the brain stores long-term memories using this mechanism. Nevertheless, when the CaMKII
enzyme is dephosphorylated by a phosphatase enzyme, it becomes inactive, and memories are lost. Hence,
CaMKII plays a vital role in both the induction and maintenance of LTP. [32]
For technical reasons, synaptic structure and function have been historically studied at unusually large
model synapses, for example:
Squid giant synapse
Neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a cholinergic synapse in vertebrates, glutamatergic in
insects
Ciliary calyx in the ciliary ganglion of chicks[33]
Calyx of Held in the brainstem
Ribbon synapse in the retina
Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampus. These synapses are small, but their pre-
and postsynaptic neurons are well separated (CA3 and CA1, respectively).
Synapses function as ensembles within particular brain networks to control the amount of neuronal activity,
which is essential for memory, learning, and behavior. Consequently, synaptic disruptions might have
negative effects. In fact, alterations in cell-intrinsic molecular systems or modifications to environmental
biochemical processes can lead to synaptic dysfunction. The synapse is the primary unit of information
transfer in the nervous system, and correct synaptic contact creation during development is essential for
normal brain function. In addition, several mutations have been connected to neurodevelopmental disorders,
and that compromised function at different synapse locations is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases.
Synaptic defects are causally associated with early appearing neurological diseases, including autism
spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BP). On the other hand, in late-onset
degenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's (HD) diseases,
synaptopathy is thought to be the inevitable end-result of an ongoing pathophysiological cascade. These
diseases are identified by a gradual loss in cognitive and behavioral function and a steady loss of brain
tissue. Moreover, these deteriorations have been mostly linked to the gradual build-up of protein aggregates
in neurons, the composition of which may vary based on the pathology; all have the same deleterious
effects on neuronal integrity. Furthermore, the high number of mutations linked to synaptic structure and
function, as well as dendritic spine alterations in post-mortem tissue, has led to the association between
synaptic defects and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD and SCZ, characterized by abnormal
behavioral or cognitive phenotypes.
Experimental models
Synapses and Diseases
Nevertheless, due to limited access to human tissue at late stages and a lack of thorough assessment of the
essential components of human diseases in the available experimental animal models, it has been difficult to
fully grasp the origin and role of synaptic dysfunction in neurological disorders. [34]

Anatomical terminology
Bronchiole
The bronchioles or bronchioli (pronounced bron-kee-oh-lee)
are the smaller branches of the bronchial airways in the lower
respiratory tract. They include the terminal bronchioles, and
finally the respiratory bronchioles that mark the start of the
respiratory zone delivering air to the gas exchanging units of
the alveoli. The bronchioles no longer contain the cartilage that
is found in the bronchi, or glands in their submucosa.[1]
The pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by
one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1 mm or less in
diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium
and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even
smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5 mm or less
in diameter. Terminal bronchioles in turn divide into smaller
respiratory bronchioles which divide into alveolar ducts.
Terminal bronchioles mark the end of the conducting division
of air flow in the respiratory system while respiratory
bronchioles are the beginning of the respiratory division where
gas exchange takes place.
The diameter of the bronchioles plays an important role in air
flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or
reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called
bronchodilation and is stimulated by either epinephrine or
sympathetic nerves to increase air flow. A decrease in diameter
is called bronchoconstriction, which is the tightening of the
smooth muscle surrounding the bronchi and bronchioles due to
and stimulated by histamine, parasympathetic nerves, cold air,
chemical irritants, excess mucus production, viral infections,
and other factors to decrease air flow. Bronchoconstriction can
result in clinical symptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness,
and dyspnea, which are common features of asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic bronchitis.
[2]
The trachea divides into the left main bronchus which supplies
the left lung, and the right main bronchus which supplies the right lung. As they enter the lungs these
primary bronchi branch into secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi which supply each lobe of the lung.
Structure
Bronchioles
A lobule of the lung enclosed in
septa and supplied by a terminal
bronchiole that branches into the
respiratory bronchioles. Each
respiratory bronchiole supplies the
alveoli held in each acinus
accompanied by a pulmonary artery
branch.
Lungs showing bronchi and bronchioles
These in turn give rise to tertiary bronchi (tertiary meaning ""third""),
known as segmental bronchi which supply each bronchopulmonary
segment.[1] The segmentary bronchi subdivide into fourth order,
fifth order and sixth order segmental bronchi before dividing into
the bronchioles. The bronchioles are histologically distinct from the
bronchi in that their walls do not have hyaline cartilage and they
have club cells in their epithelial lining. The epithelium of the
bronchioles starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and
changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles
decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be
less than 1 mm, though this value can range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm.
As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to
maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to
the surrounding lung tissue for support. The inner lining (lamina
propria) of these bronchioles is thin with no glands present, and is
surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle. As the bronchioles get
smaller they divide into terminal bronchioles. Each bronchiole
divides into between 50 and 80 terminal bronchioles.[3] These
bronchioles mark the end of the conducting zone, which covers the
first division through the sixteenth division of the
respiratory tract. Alveoli only become present
when the conducting zone changes to the
respiratory zone, from the sixteenth through the
twenty-third division of the tract.
The terminal bronchioles are the most distal
segment of the conducting zone. They branch
off the lesser bronchioles. Each of the terminal
bronchioles 
divides 
to 
form 
respiratory
bronchioles which contain a small number of
alveoli. Terminal bronchioles are lined with
simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium containing club cells. Club cells are non-ciliated, rounded protein-
secreting cells. Their secretions are a non-sticky, proteinaceous compound to maintain the airway in the
smallest bronchioles. The secretion, called pulmonary surfactant, reduces surface tension, allowing for
bronchioles to expand during inspiration and keeping the bronchioles from collapsing during expiration.
Club cells are a stem cell of the respiratory system, and also produce enzymes that detoxify substances
dissolved in the respiratory fluid.
Terminal bronchioles
Respiratory bronchioles
The respiratory bronchioles are the narrowest airways of the lungs, 0.5 mm across.[4] The bronchi divide
many times before evolving into the bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles deliver air to the exchange
surfaces of the lungs.[5] They are interrupted by alveoli which are thin walled evaginations. Alveolar ducts
are side branches of the respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles are lined by ciliated columnar
epithelium along with some non-ciliated cells called club cells.[6]
Bronchospasm, a potentially life-threatening situation, occurs when the smooth muscular tissue of the
bronchioles constricts, severely narrowing their diameter. The most common cause of this is asthma.
Bronchospasm is commonly treated by oxygen therapy and bronchodilators such as albuterol.
Diseases of the bronchioles include asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans, respiratory syncytial virus infections,
and influenza.
The medical condition of inflammation of the bronchioles is termed bronchiolitis.[7]

Bronchus
A bronchus (/'braNGk@s/ BRONG-k@s; pl.: bronchi, /'braNGkaI/
BRONG-ky) is a passage or airway in the lower respiratory tract
that conducts air into the lungs. The first or primary bronchi to
branch from the trachea at the carina are the right main
bronchus and the left main bronchus. These are the widest
bronchi, and enter the right lung, and the left lung at each
hilum. The main bronchi branch into narrower secondary
bronchi or lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower
tertiary bronchi or segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the
segmental bronchi are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th
order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental
bronchi.[1][2] The bronchi, when too narrow to be supported by
cartilage, are known as bronchioles. No gas exchange takes
place in the bronchi.
The trachea (windpipe) divides at the carina into two main or
primary bronchi, the left bronchus and the right bronchus.
The carina of the trachea is located at the level of the sternal
angle and the fifth thoracic vertebra (at rest).
The right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical
than the left main bronchus,[3] its mean length is 1.09 cm.[4] It
enters the root of the right lung at approximately the fifth
thoracic vertebra. The right main bronchus subdivides into three
secondary bronchi (also known as lobar bronchi), which
deliver oxygen to the three lobes of the right lung--the
superior, middle and inferior lobe. The azygos vein arches over
it from behind; and the right pulmonary artery lies at first below
and then in front of it. About 2 cm from its commencement it
gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the right lung, which
is also called the eparterial bronchus. Eparterial refers to its
position above the right pulmonary artery. The right bronchus
now passes below the artery, and is known as the hyparterial
branch which divides into the two lobar bronchi to the middle
and lower lobes.
The left main bronchus is smaller in caliber but longer than
the right, being 5  cm long. It enters the root of the left lung
opposite the sixth thoracic vertebra. It passes beneath the aortic
arch, crosses in front of the esophagus, the thoracic duct, and

Anatomical terminology
the descending aorta, and has the left pulmonary artery lying at
first above, and then in front of it. The left bronchus has no
eparterial branch, and therefore it has been supposed by some
that there is no upper lobe to the left lung, but that the so-called
upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the right lung. The
left main bronchus divides into two secondary bronchi or lobar
bronchi, to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung--the
superior and the inferior lobe.
The secondary bronchi divide further into tertiary bronchi,
(also known as segmental bronchi), each of which supplies a
bronchopulmonary segment. A bronchopulmonary segment is a
division of a lung separated from the rest of the lung by a
septum of connective tissue. This property allows a
bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without
affecting other segments. Initially, there are ten segments in each lung, but during development with the left
lung having just two lobes, two pairs of segments fuse to give eight, four for each lobe. The tertiary bronchi
divide further in another three branchings known as 4th order, 5th order and 6th order segmental bronchi
which are also referred to as subsegmental bronchi. These branch into many smaller bronchioles which
divide into terminal bronchioles, each of which then gives rise to several respiratory bronchioles, which go
on to divide into two to eleven alveolar ducts. There are five or six alveolar sacs associated with each
alveolar duct. The alveolus is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange in the lung.
The main bronchi have relatively large lumens that are lined by respiratory epithelium. This cellular lining
has cilia departing towards the mouth which removes dust and other small particles. There is a smooth
muscle layer below the epithelium arranged as two ribbons of muscle that spiral in opposite directions. This
smooth muscle layer contains seromucous glands, which secrete mucus, in its wall. Hyaline cartilage is
present in the bronchi, surrounding the smooth muscle layer. In the main bronchi, the cartilage forms C-
shaped rings like those in the trachea, while in the smaller bronchi, hyaline cartilage is present in irregularly
arranged crescent-shaped plates and islands. These plates give structural support to the bronchi and keep the
airway open.[5]
The bronchial wall normally has a thickness of 10% to 20% of the total bronchial diameter.[6]
The cartilage and mucous membrane of the main bronchus (primary bronchi) are similar to those in the
trachea. They are lined with respiratory epithelium, which is classified as ciliated pseudostratified columnar
epithelium.[7] The epithelium in the main bronchi contains goblet cells, which are glandular, modified
simple columnar epithelial cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. Mucus plays an
important role in keeping the airways clear in the mucociliary clearance process.

As branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of
hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases until it is absent in the
bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth
muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a
transition from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, to
simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium, to simple squamous epithelium
in the alveolar ducts and alveoli[7][8]
In 0.1 to 5% of people there is a right superior lobe bronchus arising
from the main stem bronchus prior to the carina. This is known as a
tracheal bronchus, and seen as an anatomical variation.[9] It can
have multiple variations and, although usually asymptomatic, it can
be the root cause of pulmonary disease such as a recurrent infection.
In such cases resection is often curative.[10] [11]
The cardiac bronchus has a prevalence of 0.3% and presents as an accessory bronchus arising from the
bronchus intermedius between the upper lobar bronchus and the origin of the middle and lower lobar
bronchi of the right main bronchus.[12]
An accessory cardiac bronchus is usually an asymptomatic condition but may be associated with persistent
infection or hemoptysis.[13][14] In about half of observed cases the cardiac bronchus presents as a short
dead-ending bronchial stump, in the remainder the bronchus may exhibit branching and associated aerated
lung parenchyma.
The bronchi function to carry air that is breathed in through to the functional tissues of the lungs, called
alveoli. Exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the
walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli. The alveolar ducts and alveoli consist primarily of simple squamous
epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Bronchial wall thickening, as can be seen on CT scan, generally (but not always)
implies inflammation of the bronchi (bronchitis).[15] Normally, the ratio of the
bronchial wall thickness and the bronchial diameter is between 0.17 and 0.23.[16]
Bronchitis is defined as inflammation of the bronchi, which can either be acute or
chronic. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections. Many
sufferers of chronic bronchitis also suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), and this is usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure to irritants.

Aspiration
The left main bronchus departs from the trachea at a greater angle than that of the right main bronchus. The
right bronchus is also wider than the left and these differences predispose the right lung to aspirational
problems. If food, liquids, or foreign bodies are aspirated, they will tend to lodge in the right main bronchus.
Bacterial pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia may result.
If a tracheal tube used for intubation is inserted too far, it will usually lodge in the right bronchus, allowing
ventilation only of the right lung.
Asthma is marked by hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi with an inflammatory component, often in
response to allergens.
In asthma, the constriction of the bronchi can result in difficulty in breathing giving shortness of breath; this
can lead to a lack of oxygen reaching the body for cellular processes. In this case, an inhaler can be used to
rectify the problem. The inhaler administers a bronchodilator, which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi
and to re-expand the airways. This effect occurs quite quickly.
Bronchial atresia is a rare congenital disorder that can have a varied appearance. A bronchial atresia is a
defect in the development of the bronchi, affecting one or more bronchi - usually segmental bronchi and
sometimes lobar. The defect takes the form of a blind-ended bronchus. The surrounding tissue secretes
mucus normally but builds up and becomes distended.[17] This can lead to regional emphysema.[18]
The collected mucus may form a mucoid impaction or a bronchocele, or both. A pectus excavatum may
accompany a bronchial atresia.[17]

Anatomical terminology
Larynx
The larynx (/'laerINGks/), commonly called the voice box, is an
organ in the top of the neck involved in breathing, producing
sound and protecting the trachea against food aspiration. The
opening of larynx into pharynx known as the laryngeal inlet is
about 4-5 centimeters in diameter.[1] The larynx houses the
vocal cords, and manipulates pitch and volume, which is
essential for phonation. It is situated just below where the tract
of the pharynx splits into the trachea and the esophagus. The
word 'larynx' (pl.: larynges) comes from the Ancient Greek
word larunx `larynx, gullet, throat'.[2]
The triangle-shaped larynx consists largely of cartilages that are
attached to one another, and to surrounding structures, by
muscles or by fibrous and elastic tissue components. The larynx
is lined by a ciliated columnar epithelium except for the vocal
folds. The cavity of the larynx extends from its triangle-shaped
inlet, to the epiglottis, and to the circular outlet at the lower
border of the cricoid cartilage, where it is continuous with the
lumen of the trachea. The mucous membrane lining the larynx
forms two pairs of lateral folds that project inward into its
cavity. The upper folds are called the vestibular folds. They are
also sometimes called the false vocal cords for the rather
obvious reason that they play no part in vocalization. The
Kargyraa style of Tuvan throat singing makes use of these folds
to sing an octave lower, and they are used in Umngqokolo, a
type of Xhosa throat singing. The lower pair of folds are
known as the vocal cords, which produce sounds needed for
speech and other vocalizations. The slit-like space between the
left and right vocal cords, called the rima glottidis, is the
narrowest part of the larynx. The vocal cords and the rima
glottidis are together designated as the glottis. The laryngeal
cavity above the vestibular folds is called the vestibule. The
very middle portion of the cavity between the vestibular folds
and the vocal cords is the ventricle of the larynx, or laryngeal
ventricle. The infraglottic cavity is the open space below the
glottis.

Posterior view of the larynx; disarticulated cartilages (left) and intrinsic muscles (right)
In adult humans, the larynx is found in the anterior neck at the
level of the cervical vertebrae C3-C6. It connects the inferior part
of the pharynx (hypopharynx) with the trachea. The laryngeal
skeleton consists of nine cartilages: three single (epiglottic, thyroid
and cricoid) and three paired (arytenoid, corniculate, and
cuneiform).[3] The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx, though the
larynx is suspended from the hyoid. The larynx extends vertically
from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior border of the cricoid
cartilage. Its interior can be divided in supraglottis, glottis and
subglottis.
There are nine cartilages, three unpaired and three paired
(3 pairs=6), that support the mammalian larynx and form
its skeleton.
Unpaired cartilages:
Thyroid cartilage: This forms the Adam's apple
(also called the laryngeal prominence). It is
usually larger in
males than in
females. The
thyrohyoid
membrane is a
ligament
associated with
the thyroid
cartilage that
connects it with
the hyoid bone.
It supports the
front portion of
the larynx.
Cricoid cartilage:
A ring of hyaline
cartilage that
forms the inferior
wall of the
larynx. It is
attached to the
top of the trachea. The median cricothyroid ligament connects the cricoid cartilage to the
thyroid cartilage.
Epiglottis: A large, spoon-shaped piece of elastic cartilage. During swallowing, the pharynx
and larynx rise. Elevation of the pharynx widens it to receive food and drink; elevation of the
larynx causes the epiglottis to move down and form a lid over the glottis, closing it off.
Paired cartilages:
Arytenoid cartilages: Of the paired cartilages, the arytenoid cartilages are the most important
because they influence the position and tension of the vocal cords. These are triangular
Cartilages
pieces of mostly hyaline cartilage located at the posterosuperior border of the cricoid
cartilage.
Corniculate cartilages: Horn-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage located at the apex of each
arytenoid cartilage.
Cuneiform cartilages: Club-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage located anterior to the
corniculate cartilages.
The muscles of the larynx are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. The extrinsic muscles act on the
region and pass between the larynx and parts around it but have their origin elsewhere; the intrinsic muscles
are confined entirely within the larynx and have their origin and insertion there.[4]
The intrinsic muscles are divided into respiratory and the phonatory muscles (the muscles of phonation).
The respiratory muscles move the vocal cords apart and serve breathing. The phonatory muscles move the
vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. The main respiratory muscles are the posterior
cricoarytenoid muscles. The phonatory muscles are divided into adductors (lateral cricoarytenoid muscles,
arytenoid muscles) and tensors (cricothyroid muscles, thyroarytenoid muscles).
The intrinsic laryngeal muscles are responsible for controlling sound production.
Cricothyroid muscle lengthen and tense the vocal cords.
Posterior cricoarytenoid muscles abduct and externally rotate the arytenoid cartilages,
resulting in abducted vocal cords.
Lateral cricoarytenoid muscles adduct and internally rotate the arytenoid cartilages, increase
medial compression.
Transverse arytenoid muscle adduct the arytenoid cartilages, resulting in adducted vocal
cords.[5]
Oblique arytenoid muscles narrow the laryngeal inlet by constricting the distance between
the arytenoid cartilages.
Thyroarytenoid muscles narrow the laryngeal inlet, shortening the vocal cords, and lowering
voice pitch. The internal thyroarytenoid is the portion of the thyroarytenoid that vibrates to
produce sound.
Notably the only muscle capable of separating the vocal cords for normal breathing is the posterior
cricoarytenoid. If this muscle is incapacitated on both sides, the inability to pull the vocal cords apart
(abduct) will cause difficulty breathing. Bilateral injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve would cause this
condition. It is also worth noting that all muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the
vagus except the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external laryngeal branch of the superior
laryngeal nerve (a branch of the vagus).
Additionally, intrinsic laryngeal muscles present a constitutive Ca2+-buffering profile that predicts their
better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles.[6] This profile is in agreement with
their function as very fast muscles with a well-developed capacity for prolonged work. Studies suggests that
mechanisms involved in the prompt sequestering of Ca2+ (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-reuptake proteins,
plasma membrane pumps, and cytosolic Ca2+-buffering proteins) are particularly elevated in laryngeal
muscles, indicating their importance for the myofiber function and protection against disease, such as

Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[7] Furthermore, different levels of Orai1 in rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles
and extraocular muscles over the limb muscle suggests a role for store operated calcium entry channels in
those muscles' functional properties and signaling mechanisms.

The larynx is innervated by branches of the vagus nerve on each side. Sensory innervation to the glottis and
laryngeal vestibule is by the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The external branch of the
superior laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle. Motor innervation to all other muscles of the
larynx and sensory innervation to the subglottis is by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. While the sensory input
described above is (general) visceral sensation (diffuse, poorly localized), the vocal cords also receives
general somatic sensory innervation (proprioceptive and touch) by the superior laryngeal nerve.
Injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve causes weakened phonation because the vocal
cords cannot be tightened. Injury to one of the recurrent laryngeal nerves produces hoarseness, if both are
damaged the voice may or may not be preserved, but breathing becomes difficult.
In newborn infants, the larynx is initially at the level of the C2-C3 vertebrae, and is further forward and
higher relative to its position in the adult body.[8] The larynx descends as the child grows.[9][10]
The laryngeal cavity (cavity of the larynx) extends from the
laryngeal inlet downwards to the lower border of the cricoid
cartilage where it is continuous with that of the trachea.[11][12]

It is divided into two parts by the projection of the vocal folds,
between which is a narrow triangular opening, the rima
glottidis.
The portion of the cavity of the larynx above the vocal folds is
called the laryngeal vestibule; it is wide and triangular in shape,
its base or anterior wall presenting, however, about its center
the backward projection of the tubercle of the epiglottis.
It contains the vestibular folds, and between these and the vocal
folds are the laryngeal ventricles.
The portion below the vocal folds is called the infraglottic
cavity. It is at first of an elliptical form, but lower down it
widens out, assumes a circular form, and is continuous with the
tube of the trachea.
Sound is generated in the larynx, and that is where pitch and
volume are manipulated. The strength of expiration from the
lungs also contributes to loudness.
Manipulation of the larynx is used to generate a source sound
with a particular fundamental frequency, or pitch. This source
sound is altered as it travels through the vocal tract, configured
differently based on the position of the tongue, lips, mouth, and
pharynx. The process of altering a source sound as it passes
through the filter of the vocal tract creates the many different
vowel and consonant sounds of the world's languages as well
as tone, certain realizations of stress and other types of linguistic
prosody. The larynx also has a similar function to the lungs in
creating pressure differences required for sound production; a
constricted larynx can be raised or lowered affecting the
volume of the oral cavity as necessary in glottalic consonants.
The vocal cords can be held close together (by adducting the
arytenoid cartilages) so that they vibrate (see phonation). The
muscles attached to the arytenoid cartilages control the degree
of opening. Vocal cord length and tension can be controlled by
rocking the thyroid cartilage forward and backward on the
cricoid cartilage (either directly by contracting the cricothyroids
or indirectly by changing the vertical position of the larynx), by
manipulating the tension of the muscles within the vocal cords,
and by moving the arytenoids forward or backward. This

causes the pitch produced during phonation to rise or fall. In
most males the vocal cords are longer and have a greater mass
than most females' vocal cords, producing a lower pitch.
The vocal apparatus consists of two pairs of folds, the
vestibular folds (false vocal cords) and the true vocal cords. The
vestibular folds are covered by respiratory epithelium, while the
vocal cords are covered by stratified squamous epithelium. The
vestibular folds are not responsible for sound production, but
rather for resonance. The exceptions to this are found in Tibetan
chanting and Kargyraa, a style of Tuvan throat singing. Both
make use of the vestibular folds to create an undertone. These
false vocal cords do not contain muscle, while the true vocal
cords do have skeletal muscle.
The most important role of the larynx is its protective function, the
prevention of foreign objects from entering the lungs by coughing
and other reflexive actions. A cough is initiated by a deep inhalation
through the vocal cords, followed by the elevation of the larynx and
the tight adduction (closing) of the vocal cords. The forced
expiration that follows, assisted by tissue recoil and the muscles of
expiration, blows the vocal cords apart, and the high pressure
expels the irritating object out of the throat. Throat clearing is less
violent than coughing, but is a similar increased respiratory effort
countered by the tightening of the laryngeal musculature. Both
coughing and throat clearing are predictable and necessary actions
because they clear the respiratory passageway, but both place the
vocal cords under significant strain.[13]
Another important role of the larynx is abdominal fixation, a kind of Valsalva maneuver in which the lungs
are filled with air in order to stiffen the thorax so that forces applied for lifting can be translated down to the
legs. This is achieved by a deep inhalation followed by the adduction of the vocal cords. Grunting while
lifting heavy objects is the result of some air escaping through the adducted vocal cords ready for
phonation.[13]
Abduction of the vocal cords is important during physical exertion. The vocal cords are separated by about
8 mm (0.31 in) during normal respiration, but this width is doubled during forced respiration.[13]
During swallowing, elevation of the posterior portion of the tongue levers (inverts) the epiglottis over the
glottis' opening to prevent swallowed material from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs, and
provides a path for a food or liquid bolus to ""slide"" into the esophagus; the hyo-laryngeal complex is also
pulled upwards to assist this process. Stimulation of the larynx by aspirated food or liquid produces a strong
cough reflex to protect the lungs.

In addition, intrinsic laryngeal muscles are spared from some muscle wasting disorders, such as Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, may facilitate the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of
muscle wasting in a variety of clinical scenarios. ILM have a calcium regulation system profile suggestive
of a better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles, and this may provide a
mechanistic insight for their unique pathophysiological properties[6]
There are several things that can cause a larynx to not function properly.[14] Some symptoms are
hoarseness, loss of voice, pain in the throat or ears, and breathing difficulties.
Acute laryngitis is the sudden inflammation and swelling of the larynx. It is caused by the
common cold or by excessive shouting. It is not serious.
Chronic laryngitis is caused by smoking, dust, frequent yelling, or prolonged exposure to
polluted air. It is much more serious than acute laryngitis.
Presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related atrophy of the soft tissues of the larynx
results in weak voice and restricted vocal range and stamina. Bowing of the anterior portion
of the vocal colds is found on laryngoscopy.
Ulcers may be caused by the prolonged presence of an endotracheal tube.
Polyps and vocal cord nodules are small bumps caused by prolonged exposure to tobacco
smoke and vocal misuse, respectively.
Two related types of cancer of the larynx, namely squamous cell carcinoma and verrucous
carcinoma, are strongly associated with repeated exposure to cigarette smoke and alcohol.
Vocal cord paresis is weakness of one or both vocal cords that can greatly impact daily life.
Idiopathic laryngeal spasm.
Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a condition in which acid from the stomach irritates and burns
the larynx. Similar damage can occur with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).[15][16]
Laryngomalacia is a very common condition of infancy, in which the soft, immature cartilage
of the upper larynx collapses inward during inhalation, causing airway obstruction.
Laryngeal perichondritis, the inflammation of the perichondrium of laryngeal cartilages,
causing airway obstruction.
Laryngeal paralysis is a condition seen in some mammals (including dogs) in which the
larynx no longer opens as wide as required for the passage of air, and impedes respiration.
In mild cases it can lead to exaggerated or ""raspy"" breathing or panting, and in serious cases
can pose a considerable need for treatment.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILM) are spared from the lack of
dystrophin and may serve as a useful model to study the mechanisms of muscle sparing in
neuromuscular diseases.[7] Dystrophic ILM presented a significant increase in the
expression of calcium-binding proteins. The increase of calcium-binding proteins in
dystrophic ILM may permit better maintenance of calcium homeostasis, with the consequent
absence of myonecrosis. The results further support the concept that abnormal calcium
buffering is involved in these neuromuscular diseases.[17]

Patients who have lost the use of their larynx are typically prescribed the use of an electrolarynx
device.[18][19][20] Larynx transplants are a rare procedure.[20][21] The world's first successful operation took
place in 1998 at the Cleveland Clinic,[22] and the second took place in October 2010 at the University of
California Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.[23]
Pioneering work on the structure and evolution of the larynx was carried out
in the 1920s by the British comparative anatomist Victor Negus, culminating
in his monumental work The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929). Negus,
however, pointed out that the descent of the larynx reflected the reshaping
and descent of the human tongue into the pharynx. This process is not
complete until age six to eight years. Some researchers, such as Philip
Lieberman, Dennis Klatt, Bart de Boer and Kenneth Stevens using
computer-modeling techniques have suggested that the species-specific
human tongue allows the vocal tract (the airway above the larynx) to assume
the shapes necessary to produce speech sounds that enhance the robustness
of human speech. Sounds such as the vowels of the words <see>  and <do> , [i]
and [u] (in phonetic notation), have been shown to be less subject to
confusion in classic studies such as the 1950 Peterson and Barney
investigation of the possibilities for computerized speech recognition.[24]
In contrast, though other species have low larynges, their tongues remain
anchored in their mouths and their vocal tracts cannot produce the range of
speech sounds of humans. The ability to lower the larynx transiently in some
species extends the length of their vocal tract, which as Fitch showed creates
the acoustic illusion that they are larger. Research at Haskins Laboratories in
the 1960s showed that speech allows humans to achieve a vocal
communication rate that exceeds the fusion frequency of the auditory system
by fusing sounds together into syllables and words. The additional speech
sounds that the human tongue enables us to produce, particularly [i], allow
humans to unconsciously infer the length of the vocal tract of the person who
is talking, a critical element in recovering the phonemes that make up a
word.[24]
Most tetrapod species possess a larynx, but its structure is typically simpler than that found in mammals.
The cartilages surrounding the larynx are apparently a remnant of the original gill arches in fish, and are a
common feature, but not all are always present. For example, the thyroid cartilage is found only in
mammals. Similarly, only mammals possess a true epiglottis, although a flap of non-cartilagenous mucosa is
found in a similar position in many other groups. In modern amphibians, the laryngeal skeleton is
considerably reduced; frogs have only the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages, while salamanders possess only
the arytenoids.[25]
Other animals
Non-mammals
An example of a frog that possesses a larynx is tungara frog. While larynx is the main sound producing
organ in tungara frogs, it serves a higher significance due to its contribution to mating call, which consist of
two components: 'whine' and 'chuck'.[26] While 'whine' induces female phonotaxis and allows species
recognition, 'chuck' increases mating attractiveness.[27] In particular, tungara frog produces 'chuck' by
vibrating the fibrous mass attached to the larynx.[27]
Vocal folds are found only in mammals, and a few lizards. As a result, many reptiles and amphibians are
essentially voiceless; frogs use ridges in the trachea to modulate sound, while birds have a separate sound-
producing organ, the syrinx.[25]
The ancient Greek physician Galen first described the larynx, describing it as the ""first and supremely most
important instrument of the voice"".[28]

Lung
The lungs are the central organs of the respiratory system in
humans and most other animals, including some snails and a
small number of fish. In mammals and most other vertebrates,
two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the
heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract
oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to
release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the
atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. The pleurae, which
are thin, smooth, and moist, serve to reduce friction between the
lungs and chest wall during breathing, allowing for easy and
effortless movements of the lungs.
Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different
species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles
to support and foster breathing. In earlier tetrapods, air was
driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal
pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the
main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the
diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal
sounds including human speech possible.
Humans have two lungs, one on the left and one on the right.
They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest. The
right lung is bigger and heavier than the left, which shares
space in the chest with the heart. The lungs together weigh
approximately 1.3 kilograms (2.9 pounds). The lungs are part
of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and
branches into the bronchi and bronchioles, and which receive
air breathed in via the conducting zone. The conducting zone
ends at the terminal bronchioles. These divide into the
respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide
into alveolar ducts that give rise to the alveolar sacs that contain
the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. Alveoli are also
sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and
alveolar ducts. Together, the lungs contain approximately 2,400
kilometres (1,500 miles) of airways and 300 to 500 million
alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two
membranes called pleurae; the membranes are separated by a
film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer
membranes to slide over each other whilst breathing takes
place, without much friction. The inner pleura also divides each

lung into sections called lobes. The right lung has three lobes
and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into
bronchopulmonary segments and pulmonary lobules. The lungs
have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood
from the heart in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of
receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate
supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the
bronchial circulation. Deoxygenated blood travels from the
heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs to be
oxygenated in capillaries of alveoli. After the blood is
oxygenated, it returns to the heart through the pulmonary vein
to be sent to the rest of the body.[1][2]  
The tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and lung
cancer. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be
related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances. A number of occupational lung diseases can be
caused by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust. Diseases such as
bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. Medical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-,
from the Latin pulmonarius (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek pneumon
""lung"") as in pneumonia.
In embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes
on to form the upper part of the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-
filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the
ductus arteriosus. At birth, however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes,
so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.
The lungs are located in the chest on either side of
the heart in the rib cage. They are conical in shape
with a narrow rounded apex at the top, and a
broad concave base that rests on the convex
surface of the diaphragm.[3] The apex of the lung
extends into the root of the neck, reaching shortly
above the level of the sternal end of the first rib.
The lungs stretch from close to the backbone in
the rib cage to the front of the chest and
downwards from the lower part of the trachea to
the diaphragm.[3]
The left lung shares space with the heart, and has an indentation in its border called the cardiac notch of
the left lung to accommodate this.[4][5] The front and outer sides of the lungs face the ribs, which make
light indentations on their surfaces. The medial surfaces of the lungs face towards the centre of the chest,

and lie against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where the trachea divides into the two main
bronchi.[5] The cardiac impression is an indentation formed on the surfaces of the lungs where they rest
against the heart.
Both lungs have a central recession called the hilum, where the blood vessels and airways pass into the
lungs making up the root of the lung.[6] There are also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum.[5]
The lungs are surrounded by the pulmonary pleurae. The pleurae are two serous membranes; the outer
parietal pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly lines the surface of
the lungs. Between the pleurae is a potential space called the pleural cavity containing a thin layer of
lubricating pleural fluid.
Each lung is divided into sections called lobes by
the infoldings of the visceral pleura as fissures.
Lobes are divided into segments, and segments
have further divisions as lobules. There are three
lobes in the right lung and two lobes in the left
lung.
The fissures are formed in early prenatal
development by invaginations of the visceral
pleura that divide the lobar bronchi, and section
the lungs into lobes that helps in their
expansion.[8][9] The right lung is divided into
three lobes by a horizontal fissure, and an
oblique fissure. The left lung is divided into two
lobes by an oblique fissure which is closely
aligned with the oblique fissure in the right lung.
In the right lung the upper horizontal fissure,
separates the upper (superior) lobe from the middle lobe. The lower, oblique fissure separates the lower lobe
from the middle and upper lobes.[3][9]
Variations in the fissures are fairly common being either incompletely formed or present as an extra fissure
as in the azygos fissure, or absent. Incomplete fissures are responsible for interlobar collateral ventilation,
airflow between lobes which is unwanted in some lung volume reduction procedures.[8]
The main or primary bronchi enter the lungs at the hilum and initially branch into secondary bronchi also
known as lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary
bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as
bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and

arterial supply.[10] Segments for the left and right lung are shown in the table.[7] The segmental anatomy is
useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs.[7] A segment is a discrete unit that can be
surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.[11]
The left lung (left) and right lung (right). The lobes of the lungs can be seen, and the central root of the lung is also
present.
The right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left. It is divided into three lobes, an upper,
middle, and a lower lobe by two fissures, one oblique and one horizontal.[12] The upper, horizontal fissure,
separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of
the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the
fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced back to the hilum.[3] The lower, oblique
fissure, separates the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique fissure
in the left lung.[3][9]
The mediastinal surface of the right lung is indented by a number of nearby structures. The heart sits in an
impression called the cardiac impression. Above the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for the azygos
vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein; behind this,
and close to the top of the lung is a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. There is a groove for the
esophagus behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal groove
is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.[5]
The weight of the right lung varies between individuals, with a standard reference range in men of 155-
720 g (0.342-1.587 lb)[13] and in women of 100-590 g (0.22-1.30 lb).[14]
The left lung is divided into two lobes, an upper and a lower lobe, by the oblique fissure, which extends
from the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum.[3] The left lung,
unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does have a homologous feature, a projection of the
upper lobe termed the lingula. Its name means ""little tongue"". The lingula on the left lung serves as an
anatomic parallel to the middle lobe on the right lung, with both areas being predisposed to similar
infections and anatomic complications.[15][16] There are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula:
superior and inferior.[3]
Right lung
Left lung
The mediastinal surface of the left lung has a large cardiac impression where the heart sits. This is deeper
and larger than that on the right lung, at which level the heart projects to the left.[5]
On the same surface, immediately above the hilum, is a well-marked curved groove for the aortic arch, and
a groove below it for the descending aorta. The left subclavian artery, a branch off the aortic arch, sits in a
groove from the arch to near the apex of the lung. A shallower groove in front of the artery and near the
edge of the lung, lodges the left brachiocephalic vein. The esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression
at the base of the lung.[5]
By standard reference range, the weight of the left lung is 110-675 g (0.243-1.488 lb)[13] in men and 105-
515 g (0.231-1.135 lb) in women.[14]

The lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch
from the trachea. The bronchial airways terminate in alveoli which make up the functional tissue
(parenchyma) of the lung, and veins, arteries, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.[5][17] The trachea and bronchi
have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi have a single layer
of lymph capillaries, and they are absent in the alveoli.[18] The lungs are supplied with the largest lymphatic

drainage system of any other organ in the body.[19] Each
lung is surrounded by a serous membrane of visceral
pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose connective
tissue attached to the substance of the lung.[20]
The connective tissue of the lungs is made up of elastic
and collagen fibres that are interspersed between the
capillaries and the alveolar walls. Elastin is the key protein
of the extracellular matrix and is the main component of
the elastic fibres.[21] Elastin gives the necessary elasticity
and resilience required for the persistent stretching
involved in breathing, known as lung compliance. It is
also responsible for the elastic recoil needed. Elastin is more
concentrated in areas of high stress such as the openings of the
alveoli, and alveolar junctions.[21] The connective tissue links all
the alveoli to form the lung parenchyma which has a sponge-like
appearance. The alveoli have interconnecting air passages in their
walls known as the pores of Kohn.[22]
All of the lower respiratory tract including the trachea, bronchi, and
bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated
epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucin the
main component of mucus, ciliated cells, basal cells, and in the
terminal bronchioles-club cells with actions similar to basal cells,
and macrophages. The epithelial cells, and the submucosal glands
throughout the respiratory tract secrete airway surface liquid (ASL),
the composition of which is tightly regulated and determines how
well mucociliary clearance works.[23]
Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are found throughout the
respiratory epithelium including the alveolar epithelium,[24] though
they only account for around 0.5 percent of the total epithelial
population.[25] PNECs are innervated airway epithelial cells that are
particularly focused at airway junction points.[25] These cells can
produce serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, as well as
polypeptide products. Cytoplasmic processes from the pulmonary
neuroendocrine cells extend into the airway lumen where they may sense the composition of inspired
gas.[26]
Connective tissue
Respiratory epithelium
Bronchial airways
A lobule of the lung enclosed in
septa and supplied by a terminal
bronchiole that branches into the
respiratory bronchioles. Each
respiratory bronchiole supplies the
alveoli held in each acinus
accompanied by a pulmonary artery
branch.
Alveoli and their capillary networks
In the bronchi there are incomplete tracheal rings of cartilage and smaller plates of cartilage that keep them
open.[27]: 
472  Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this
is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium.[27]: 
472  The
absence of cartilage in the terminal bronchioles gives them an alternative name of membranous
bronchioles.[28]
The conducting zone of the respiratory tract ends at the terminal
bronchioles when they branch into the respiratory bronchioles. This
marks the beginning of the terminal respiratory unit called the
acinus which includes the respiratory bronchioles, the alveolar
ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli.[29] An acinus measures up to
10 mm in diameter.[30] A primary pulmonary lobule is the part of
the lung distal to the respiratory bronchiole.[31] Thus, it includes the
alveolar ducts, sacs, and alveoli but not the respiratory
bronchioles.[32]
The unit described as the secondary pulmonary lobule is the
lobule most referred to as the pulmonary lobule or respiratory
lobule.[27]: 
489 
[33] This lobule is a discrete unit that is the smallest
component of the lung that can be seen without aid.[31] The
secondary pulmonary lobule is likely to be made up of between 30
and 50 primary lobules.[32] The lobule is supplied by a terminal
bronchiole that branches into respiratory bronchioles. The
respiratory bronchioles supply the alveoli in each acinus and is
accompanied by a pulmonary artery branch. Each lobule is enclosed by an interlobular septum. Each acinus
is incompletely separated by an intralobular septum.[30]
The respiratory bronchiole gives rise to the alveolar ducts that lead to the alveolar sacs, which contain two
or more alveoli.[22] The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin allowing a fast rate of diffusion. The alveoli
have interconnecting small air passages in their walls known as the pores of Kohn.[22]
Alveoli consist of two types of alveolar cell and an alveolar
macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II
cells[34] (also known as pneumocytes).[5] Types I and II make up
the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface
area of each alveoli and are flat (""squamous""), and Type II cells
generally cluster in the corners of the alveoli and have a cuboidal
shape.[35] Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or
6:4.[34][35]
Type I are squamous epithelial cells that make up the alveolar wall
structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas
exchange.[34] These type I cells also make up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa

membranes.[35] Type I cells are not able to divide, and
consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.[35]
Type II are larger and they line the alveoli and produce and secrete
epithelial lining fluid, and lung surfactant.[36][34] Type II cells are
able to divide and differentiate to Type I cells.[35]
The alveolar macrophages have an important role in the immune
system. They remove substances which deposit in the alveoli
including loose red blood cells that have been forced out from
blood vessels.[35]
There is a large presence of microorganisms in the lungs known as the lung microbiota that interacts with
the airway epithelial cells; an interaction of probable importance in maintaining homeostasis. The
microbiota is complex and dynamic in healthy people, and altered in diseases such as asthma and COPD.
For example significant changes can take place in COPD following infection with rhinovirus.[37] Fungal
genera that are commonly found as mycobiota in the microbiota include Candida, Malassezia,
Saccharomyces, and Aspergillus.[38][39]
The lower respiratory tract is part of the respiratory system, and consists of
the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs.[34] The
trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it
splits (the carina) into a right and left primary bronchus. These supply air to
the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and
tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller
bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn
supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of
gases take place.[34] Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the
alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation,[22] and
carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.
Estimates of the total surface area of lungs vary from 50 to 75 square metres
(540 to 810 sq ft);[34][35] although this is often quoted in textbooks and the
media being ""the size of a tennis court"",[35][40][41] it is actually less than half the size of a singles court.[42]
The bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order to hold open the airways.
The bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded instead by smooth muscle.[35] Air is warmed to
37 degC (99 degF), humidified and cleansed by the conducting zone. Particles from the air being removed by the
cilia on the respiratory epithelium lining the passageways,[43] in a process called mucociliary clearance.

3D rendering of a high-resolution CT scan of the thorax.
The anterior thoracic wall, the airways and the
pulmonary vessels anterior to the root of the lung have
been digitally removed in order to visualize the different
levels of the pulmonary circulation.
Pulmonary stretch receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways initiate a reflex known as the Hering-
Breuer reflex that prevents the lungs from over-inflation, during forceful inspiration.
The lungs have a dual blood supply provided by a
bronchial and a pulmonary circulation.[6] The
bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood to
the airways of the lungs, through the bronchial
arteries that leave the aorta. There are usually
three arteries, two to the left lung and one to the
right, and they branch alongside the bronchi and
bronchioles.[34] The pulmonary circulation carries
deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
and returns the oxygenated blood to the heart to
supply the rest of the body.[34]
The blood volume of the lungs is about 450
millilitres on average, about 9% of the total blood
volume of the entire circulatory system. This
quantity can easily fluctuate from between one-
half and twice the normal volume. Also, in the
event of blood loss through hemorrhage, blood
from the lungs can partially compensate by automatically transferring to the systemic circulation.[44]
The lungs are supplied by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the parasympathetic nervous
system occurs via the vagus nerve.[6] When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the
smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands.[45] The lungs
also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 adrenoceptors in the respiratory tract,
which causes bronchodilation.[46]
The action of breathing takes place because of nerve signals sent by the respiratory center in the brainstem,
along the phrenic nerve from the cervical plexus to the diaphragm.[47]
The lobes of the lung are subject to anatomical variations.[48] A horizontal interlobar fissure was found to be
incomplete in 25% of right lungs, or even absent in 11% of all cases. An accessory fissure was also found in
14% and 22% of left and right lungs, respectively.[49] An oblique fissure was found to be incomplete in
21% to 47% of left lungs.[50] In some cases a fissure is absent, or extra, resulting in a right lung with only
two lobes, or a left lung with three lobes.[48]

Variation
Lungs during development, showing
the early branching of the primitive
bronchial buds
A variation in the airway branching structure has been found specifically in the central airway branching.
This variation is associated with the development of COPD in adulthood.[51]
The development of the human lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over
several weeks in the foetus and for several years following birth.[52]
The larynx, trachea, bronchi and lungs that make up the respiratory tract, begin to form during the fourth
week of embryogenesis[53] from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the caudal portion of the
foregut.[54]
The respiratory tract has a branching structure, and is also known as
the respiratory tree.[55] In the embryo this structure is developed in
the process of branching morphogenesis,[56] and is generated by the
repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the
lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching
tubes. The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a
bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a
bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles.[57] The
branching is a result of the tip of each tube bifurcating.[55] The
branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately
the alveoli.[55] The four genes mostly associated with branching
morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein -
sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein
BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed
for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10.[55][57] The development of the alveoli is influenced by a
different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the
alveoli.
At the end of the fourth week the lung bud divides into two, the right and left primary bronchial buds on
each side of the trachea.[58][59] During the fifth week the right bud branches into three secondary bronchial
buds and the left branches into two secondary bronchial buds. These give rise to the lobes of the lungs,
three on the right and two on the left. Over the following week, the secondary buds branch into tertiary
buds, about ten on each side.[59] From the sixth week to the sixteenth week, the major elements of the lungs
appear except the alveoli.[60] From week 16 to week 26, the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes
highly vascularised. Bronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop. By week 26 the terminal bronchioles
have formed which branch into two respiratory bronchioles.[61] During the period covering the 26th week
until birth the important blood-air barrier is established. Specialised type I alveolar cells where gas
exchange will take place, together with the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactant, appear.
The surfactant reduces the surface tension at the air-alveolar surface which allows expansion of the alveolar
sacs. The alveolar sacs contain the primitive alveoli that form at the end of the alveolar ducts,[62] and their
appearance around the seventh month marks the point at which limited respiration would be possible, and
the premature baby could survive.[52]
Development
Vitamin A deficiency
The developing lung is particularly vulnerable to changes in the levels of vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency
has been linked to changes in the epithelial lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma. This can disrupt
the normal physiology of the lung and predispose to respiratory diseases. Severe nutritional deficiency in
vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar walls (septa) and to notable changes in the
respiratory epithelium; alterations are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the
basement membrane. The extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement membrane is
associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air barrier. The deficiency is associated
with functional defects and disease states. Vitamin A is crucial in the development of the alveoli which
continues for several years after birth.[63]
At birth, the baby's lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated. After birth the
infant's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment. This triggers
the first breath, within about 10 seconds after delivery.[64] Before birth, the lungs are filled with fetal lung
fluid.[65] After the first breath, the fluid is quickly absorbed into the body or exhaled. The resistance in the
lung's blood vessels decreases giving an increased surface area for gas exchange, and the lungs begin to
breathe spontaneously. This accompanies other changes which result in an increased amount of blood
entering the lung tissues.[64]
At birth the lungs are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli of the adult lung
present.[52] The alveoli continue to form into early adulthood, and their ability to form when necessary is
seen in the regeneration of the lung.[66][67] Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the
single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter
a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the
alveoli being enlarged.[68]
The major function of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood.[69] The alveolar and
pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the thin blood-air barrier.[36][70][71] This thin membrane
(about 0.5 -2 mm thick) is folded into about 300 million alveoli, providing an extremely large surface area
(estimates varying between 70 and 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.[70][72]
The lungs are not capable of expanding to breathe on their own, and will only do so when there is an
increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity.[73] This is achieved by the muscles of respiration, through the
contraction of the diaphragm, and the intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the
diagram.[74] During breathing out the muscles relax, returning the lungs to their resting position.[75] At this
point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a
volume of about 2.5-3.0 litres.[75]
After birth
Function
Gas exchange
The effect of the respiratory muscles
in expanding the rib cage
During heavy breathing as in exertion, a large number of accessory
muscles in the neck and abdomen are recruited, that during
exhalation pull the ribcage down, decreasing the volume of the
thoracic cavity.[75] The FRC is now decreased, but since the lungs
cannot be emptied completely there is still about a litre of residual
air left.[75] Lung function testing is carried out to evaluate lung
volumes and capacities.
The lungs possess several characteristics which protect against
infection. The respiratory tract is lined by respiratory epithelium or
respiratory mucosa, with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This
mucociliary clearance is an important defence system against air-borne infection.[36] The dust particles and
bacteria in the inhaled air are caught in the mucosal surface of the airways, and are moved up towards the
pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia.[35][76]: 
661-730  The lining of the lung also
secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections;[76] goblet cells secrete mucus[35]
which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidants.[76]
A rare type of specialised cell called a pulmonary ionocyte that is suggested may regulate mucus viscosity
has been described.[77][78][79] In addition, the lining of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells
which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and
dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T cells
and B cells.[76]
The size of the respiratory tract and the flow of air also protect the lungs from larger particles. Smaller
particles deposit in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are trapped in
nasal hair after inhalation.[76]
In addition to their function in respiration, the lungs have a number of other functions. They are involved in
maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin
system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme
that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.[80] The lungs are involved in the blood's
acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.[73][81]
The lungs also serve a protective role. Several blood-borne substances, such as a few types of
prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs.[80] Drugs and other
substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs.[73][82] The lungs filter out small blood clots
from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.[81]
The lungs also play a pivotal role in speech by providing air and airflow for the creation of vocal
sounds,[73][83] and other paralanguage communications such as sighs and gasps.
Research suggests a role of the lungs in the production of blood platelets.[84]

Gene and protein expression
Tissue death of the lung due to a
pulmonary embolism
About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are
expressed in the normal lung.[85][86] A little less than 200 of these genes are more specifically expressed in
the lung with less than 20 genes being highly lung specific. The highest expression of lung specific proteins
are different surfactant proteins,[36] such as SFTPA1, SFTPB and SFTPC, and napsin, expressed in type II
pneumocytes. Other proteins with elevated expression in the lung are the dynein protein DNAH5 in ciliated
cells, and the secreted SCGB1A1 protein in mucus-secreting goblet cells of the airway mucosa.[87]
Lungs can be affected by a number of diseases and disorders. Pulmonology is the medical speciality that
deals with respiratory diseases involving the lungs and respiratory system.[88] Cardiothoracic surgery deals
with surgery of the lungs including lung volume reduction surgery, lobectomy, pneumectomy and lung
transplantation.[89]
Inflammatory conditions of the lung tissue are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and
bronchiolitis, and of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by
infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the lung tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called
pneumonitis. One major cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis.[76] Chronic infections often occur in
those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus that can lead to
an aspergilloma forming in the lung.[76][90] In the US certain species of rat can transmit a hantavirus to
humans that can cause untreatable hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with a similar presentation to that of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).[91]
Alcohol affects the lungs and can cause inflammatory alcoholic lung disease. Acute exposure to alcohol
stimulates the beating of cilia in the respiratory epithelium. However, chronic exposure has the effect of
desensitising the ciliary response which reduces mucociliary clearance (MCC). MCC is an innate defense
system protecting against pollutants and pathogens, and when this is disrupted the numbers of alveolar
macrophages are decreased. A subsequent inflammatory response is the release of cytokines. Another
consequence is the susceptibility to infection.[92][93]
A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in the
pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep
vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated
using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the
lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer.[76] Pulmonary
hypertension describes an increased pressure at the beginning of the
pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes.[76]
Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung,
such 
as 
granulomatosis 
with 
polyangiitis, 
which 
causes
inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and
kidneys.[76]

A lung contusion is a bruise caused by chest trauma. It results in hemorrhage of the alveoli causing a build-
up of fluid which can impair breathing, and this can be either mild or severe. The function of the lungs can
also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural effusion, or other substances such as
air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax), or rarer causes. These may be investigated using a chest X-ray or
CT scan, and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause is identified and
treated.[76]
Asthma, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) that includes chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, are all
obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This
limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of
constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive
lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and
diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry.
Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers
(such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as
bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as
through corticosteroids) in severe cases. A common cause of
chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, is smoking; and common
causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic
fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known, but it has
been linked to other atopic diseases.[76][94]
The breakdown of alveolar tissue, often as a result of tobacco-
smoking leads to emphysema, which can become severe enough to
develop into COPD. Elastase breaks down the elastin in the lung's
connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. Elastase is
inhibited by the acute-phase protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and when
there is a deficiency in this, emphysema can develop. With persistent stress from smoking, the airway basal
cells become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed to repair the epithelial barrier. The
disorganised basal cells are seen to be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of
COPD, and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. Studies have shown that the
initial development of emphysema is centred on the early changes in the airway epithelium of the small
airways.[95] Basal cells become further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.[95]
Some types of chronic lung diseases are classified as restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction in the
amount of lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the
lung is inflamed for a long period of time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous
connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational lung diseases such as Coalworker's
Obstructive lung diseases
Restrictive lung diseases
pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.[76] Severe respiratory
disorders, where spontaneous breathing is not enough to maintain life, may need the use of mechanical
ventilation to ensure an adequate supply of air.
Lung cancer can either arise directly from lung tissue or as a result of metastasis from another part of the
body. There are two main types of primary tumour described as either small-cell or non-small-cell lung
carcinomas. The major risk factor for cancer is smoking. Once a cancer is identified it is staged using scans
such as a CT scan and a sample of tissue from a biopsy is taken. Cancers may be treated surgically by
removing the tumour, the use of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination, or with the aim of symptom
control.[76] Lung cancer screening is being recommended in the United States for high-risk populations.[96]
Congenital disorders include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an incomplete development of the
lungs)[97]congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency
in lung surfactant. An azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without effect
can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.[98]
A pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space that causes an
uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall.[99] The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the
pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural
space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, scuba divers ascending
while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high
pressure air into the pleural space.
As part of a physical examination in response to respiratory symptoms of shortness of breath, and cough, a
lung examination may be carried out. This exam includes palpation and auscultation.[100] The areas of the
lungs that can be listened to using a stethoscope are called the lung fields, and these are the posterior, lateral,
and anterior lung fields. The posterior fields can be listened to from the back and include: the lower lobes
(taking up three quarters of the posterior fields); the anterior fields taking up the other quarter; and the lateral
fields under the axillae, the left axilla for the lingual, the right axilla for the middle right lobe. The anterior
fields can also be auscultated from the front.[101] An area known as the triangle of auscultation is an area of
thinner musculature on the back which allows improved listening.[102] Abnormal breathing sounds heard
during a lung exam can indicate the presence of a lung condition; wheezing for example is commonly
associated with asthma and COPD.
Lung function testing is carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different
circumstances.[103] The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally
500-750 mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a

respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is
expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; the remainder of the air is called the residual volume.
Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.[103]
Pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure functional residual capacity.[104] Functional residual
capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a
maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity.[105] The total lung capacity depends on the person's
age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres.[103] Females tend to have a 20-
25% lower capacity than males. Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people.
Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons tend to have a larger capacity. Lung
capacity can be increased by physical training as much as 40% but the effect may be modified by exposure
to air pollution.[105][106]
Other lung function tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) and flow of air that can be
inhaled and exhaled. The maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled is called the vital capacity. In
particular, how much a person is able to exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1)) as
a proportion of how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). This ratio, the FEV1/FEV ratio, is
important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive.[76][103] Another test is that of
the lung's diffusing capacity - this is a measure of the transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung
capillaries.
Mammal lung is one of the main types of offal, or pluck, alongside the
heart and trachea, and is consumed as a foodstuff around the world in
dishes such as Scottish haggis. The United States Food and Drug
Administration legally prohibits the sale of animal lungs due concerns
such as fungal spores or cross-contamination with other organs, although
this has been criticized as unfounded.[107]
The lungs of birds are relatively small, but are connected to 8 or 9 air sacs that extend through much of the
body, and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. On inhalation, air travels through the trachea
of a bird into the air sacs. Air then travels continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs,

Birds
On inhalation, air travels to air sacs
near the back of a bird. The air then
passes through the lungs to air sacs
near the front of the bird, from where
the air is exhaled.
The cross-current respiratory gas
exchanger in the lungs of birds. Air is
forced from the air sacs
unidirectionally (from left to right in
the diagram) through the parabronchi.
The pulmonary capillaries surround
the parabronchi in the manner shown
(blood flowing from below the
parabronchus to above it in the
diagram).[108][109] Blood or air with a
high oxygen content is shown in red;
oxygen-poor air or blood is shown in

which are relatively fixed in
size, to the air sacs at the
front. From here, the air is
exhaled. These fixed size
lungs are called ""circulatory
lungs"", as distinct from the
""bellows-type lungs"" found
in 
most 
other
animals.[108][110]
The lungs of birds contain
millions of tiny parallel
passages 
called
parabronchi. 
Small 
sacs
called atria radiate from the
walls of the tiny passages;
these, like the alveoli in
other lungs, are the site of
gas exchange by simple
diffusion.[110] The blood
flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of gas exchange (see diagram on
the right).[108][109]
The air sacs, which hold air, do not contribute much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, as they are
poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume in the thorax and
abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is
often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.[111]
Parabronchi in which the air flow is unidirectional are called paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in
all birds. Some birds, however, have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is
bidirectional. These are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.[110]
The lungs of most reptiles have a single bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches
reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs. These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but
much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In tuataras, snakes, and some
lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical amphibians.[111]
Snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is
greatly reduced, or even absent. Amphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major
left lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.[111]
Both crocodilians and monitor lizards have lungs similar to those of birds, providing a unidirectional airflow
and even possessing air sacs.[112] The now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even further refined this type
of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and
azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.[113]
Reptiles
The axolotl (Ambystoma
mexicanum) retains its larval form
with gills into adulthood.
Reptilian lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and
buccal pumping. Crocodilians also rely on the hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a
muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus,[114] which in turn creates
negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law.
Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in
and out of the lungs.[111]
The lungs of most frogs and other amphibians are simple and
balloon-like, with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of the
lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic
demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by
diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen
supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure
system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by
buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who
use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs
are inflated by expanding the rib cage.[115] In buccal pumping, the
floor of the mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The
throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.[116]
Due to the possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known lungless tetrapods
are amphibians. The majority of salamander species are lungless salamanders, which respirate through their
skin and tissues lining their mouth. This necessarily restricts their size: all are small and rather thread-like in
appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume.[117] Other known lungless tetrapods are the
Bornean flat-headed frog[118] and Atretochoana eiselti, a caecilian.[119]
The lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls (septa) of soft tissue around the outer
walls, increasing the respiratory surface area and giving the lung a honeycomb appearance. In some
salamanders even these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. In caecilians, as in snakes, only the
right lung attains any size or development.[111]
Lungs are found in three groups of fish; the coelacanths, the bichirs and the lungfish. Like in tetrapods, but
unlike fish with swim bladder, the opening is at the ventral side of the esophagus. The coelacanth has a
nonfunctional and unpaired vestigial lung surrounded by a fatty organ.[120] Bichirs, the only group of ray-
finned fish with lungs, have a pair which are hollow unchambered sacs, where the gas-exchange occurs on
very flat folds that increase their inner surface area. The lungs of lungfish show more resemblance to
tetrapod lungs. There is an elaborate network of parenchymal septa, dividing them into numerous
respiration chambers.[121][122] In the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two
lobes. Other lungfish, however, have traditionally been considered having two lungs, but newer research
defines paired lungs as bilateral lung buds that arise simultaneously and are both connected directly to the
foregut, which is only seen in tetrapods.[123] In all lungfish, including the Australian, the lungs are located
Amphibians
Fish
Book lungs of a female spider
(shown in pink)
in the upper dorsal part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. The
blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral
part of the body, as in other vertebrates.[111]
A number of invertebrates have lung-like structures that serve a
similar respiratory purpose to true vertebrate lungs, but are not
evolutionarily related and only arise out of convergent evolution.
Some arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, have structures
called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange. Some species
of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two
pairs.[124] Scorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance
of air to the book lungs.[125]
The coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air.[126] Juveniles
are released into the ocean, however adults cannot swim and possess an only rudimentary set of gills. The
adult crabs can breathe on land and hold their breath underwater.[127] The branchiostegal lungs are seen as
a developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.[128]
Pulmonates are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle cavity. An
externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to be taken into the mantle cavity
lung.[129][130]
The lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of today's fish are believed to have evolved
from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus, that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor
conditions.[131] These outpocketings first arose in the bony fish. In most of the ray-finned fish the sacs
evolved into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish, and eels have retained
the physostome condition with the sac being open to the esophagus. In more basal bony fish, such as the
gar, bichir, bowfin and the lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs.[131]
The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. Thus, the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to
the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).[132]

Nasal cavity
The nasal cavity is a large, air-filled space above and behind the
nose in the middle of the face. The nasal septum divides the cavity
into two cavities,[1] also known as fossae.[2] Each cavity is the
continuation of one of the two nostrils. The nasal cavity is the
uppermost part of the respiratory system and provides the nasal
passage for inhaled air from the nostrils to the nasopharynx and
rest of the respiratory tract.
The paranasal sinuses surround and drain into the nasal cavity.
The term ""nasal cavity"" can refer to each of the two cavities of the
nose, or to the two sides combined.
The lateral wall of each nasal cavity mainly consists of the maxilla.
However, there is a deficiency that is compensated for by the
perpendicular plate of the palatine bone, the medial pterygoid plate,
the labyrinth of ethmoid and the inferior concha. The paranasal
sinuses are connected to the nasal cavity through small orifices
called ostia. Most of these ostia communicate with the nose
through the lateral nasal wall, via a semi-lunar depression in it
known as the semilunar hiatus. The hiatus is bound laterally by a
projection known as the uncinate process. This region is called the
ostiomeatal complex.[3]
The roof of each nasal cavity is formed in its upper third to one half
by the nasal bone and more inferiorly by the junctions of the upper
lateral cartilage and nasal septum. Connective tissue and skin cover
the bony and cartilaginous components of the nasal dorsum.
The floor of the nasal cavities, which also form the roof of the
mouth, is made up by the bones of the hard palate: the horizontal
plate of the palatine bone posteriorly and the palatine process of the
maxilla anteriorly. The most anterior part of the nasal cavity is the
nasal vestibule.[4] The vestibule is enclosed by the nasal cartilages
and lined by the same epithelium of the skin (stratified squamous,
keratinized). Within the vestibule, this changes into the typical
respiratory epithelium that lines the rest of the nasal cavity and
respiratory tract. Inside the nostrils of the vestibule are the nasal
hair, which filter dust and other matter that are breathed in. The
back of the cavity blends, via the choanae, into the nasopharynx.

The nasal cavity is divided in two by the vertical nasal septum. On
the side of each nasal cavity are three horizontal outgrowths called
nasal conchae (singular ""concha"") or turbinates. These turbinates
disrupt the airflow, directing air toward the olfactory epithelium on
the surface of the turbinates and the septum. The vomeronasal
organ is located at the back of the septum and has a role in
pheromone detection.
The nasal cavity has a nasal valve area that includes an external
nasal valve and an internal nasal valve. The external nasal valve
is bounded medially by the columella, laterally by the lateral nasal
cartilage, and posteriorly by the nasal sill.[5] The internal nasal
valve is bounded laterally by the caudal border of the lateral nasal
cartilage, medially by the dorsal nasal septum, and inferiorly by the
anterior border of the inferior turbinate.[6] The internal nasal valve
is the narrowest region of the nasal cavity and is the primary site of
nasal resistance.[7]
The nasal cavity is divided into two segments: the respiratory
segment and the olfactory segment.
The respiratory segment comprises most of each nasal
cavity, and is lined with ciliated pseudostratified
columnar epithelium (also called respiratory epithelium).
The conchae, or turbinates, are located in this region.
The turbinates have a very vascularized lamina propria
(erectile tissue) allowing the venous plexuses of their mucosa to engorge with blood,
restricting airflow and causing air to be directed to the other side of the nose, which acts in
concert by shunting blood out of its turbinates. This cycle occurs approximately every two
and a half hours.
The olfactory segment is lined with a specialized type of pseudostratified columnar
epithelium, known as olfactory epithelium, which contains receptors for the sense of the
smell. This segment is located in and beneath the mucosa of the roof of each nasal cavity
and the medial side of each middle turbinate. Histological sections appear yellowish-brown
due to the presence of lipofuscin pigments. Olfactory mucosal cell types include bipolar
neurons, supporting (sustentacular) cells, basal cells, and Bowman's glands. The axons of
the bipolar neurons form the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) which enters the brain through
the cribriform plate. Bowman's glands are serous glands in the lamina propria, whose
secretions trap and dissolve odoriferous substances.
There is a rich blood supply to the nasal cavity. Blood supply comes from branches of both the internal and
external carotid artery, including branches of the facial artery and maxillary artery. The named arteries of the
nose are:
Sphenopalatine artery and greater palatine artery, branches of the maxillary artery.
Anterior ethmoidal artery and posterior ethmoidal artery, branches of the ophthalmic artery
Segments
Blood supply
Septal branches of the superior labial artery, a branch of the facial artery, which supplies the
vestibule of the nasal cavity.[8]
Innervation of the nasal cavity responsible for the sense of smell is via the olfactory nerve, which sends
microscopic fibers from the olfactory bulb through the cribriform plate to reach the top of the nasal cavity.
General sensory innervation is by branches of the trigeminal nerve (V1 and V2):
Nasociliary nerve (V1)
Anterior ethmoidal nerve from the nasociliary nerve (V1)
Posterior nasal branches of maxillary nerve (V2)
The nasal cavity is innervated by autonomic fibers. Sympathetic innervation to the blood vessels of the
mucosa causes them to constrict, while the control of secretion by the mucous glands is carried on
postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers originating from the facial nerve.
The two nasal cavities condition the air to be received by the other areas of the respiratory tract. Owing to
the large surface area provided by the nasal conchae (also known as turbinates), the air passing through the
nasal cavity is warmed or cooled to within 1 degree of body temperature. In addition, the air is humidified,
and dust and other particulate matter is removed by nasal hair in the nostrils. The entire mucosa of the nasal
cavity is covered by a blanket of mucus, which lies superficial to the microscopic cilia and also filters
inspired air. The cilia of the respiratory epithelium move the secreted mucus and particulate matter
posteriorly towards the pharynx where it passes into the esophagus and is digested in the stomach. The
nasal cavity also houses the sense of smell and contributes greatly to taste sensation through its posterior
communication with the mouth via the choanae.
Diseases of the nasal cavity include viral, bacterial and fungal infections, nasal cavity tumors, both benign
and much more often malignant, as well as inflammations of the nasal mucosa. Many problems can affect
the nose, including:
Deviated septum - a shifting of the wall that divides the nasal cavity into halves
Nasal polyps - soft growths that develop on the lining of the nose or sinuses
Nosebleeds
Rhinitis - inflammation of the nose and sinuses sometimes caused by allergies. The main
symptom is a runny nose.

Nose
A nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils,
or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside
the mouth. Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the
sinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the
pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest
of the respiratory system. In humans, the nose is located
centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory
passage especially during suckling for infants.[1][2][3] The
protruding nose that is completely separate from the mouth part
is a characteristic found only in therian mammals. It has been
theorized that this unique mammalian nose evolved from the
anterior part of the upper jaw of the reptilian-like ancestors
(synapsids).[4][5]
Acting as the first interface between the external environment
and an animal's delicate internal lungs, a nose conditions
incoming air, both as a function of thermal regulation and
filtration during respiration, as well as enabling the sensory
perception of smell.[6]
Hair inside nostrils filter incoming air, as a first line of defense
against dust particles, smoke, and other potential obstructions
that would otherwise inhibit respiration, and as a kind of filter
against airborne illness. In addition to acting as a filter, mucus
produced within the nose supplements the body's effort to maintain temperature, as well as contributes
moisture to integral components of the respiratory system. Capillary structures of the nose warm and

humidify air entering the body; later, this role in retaining moisture enables conditions for alveoli to properly
exchange O2 for CO2 (i.e., respiration) within the lungs. During exhalation, the capillaries then aid
recovery of some moisture, mostly as a function of thermal regulation, again.[7]
The wet nose of dogs is useful for the perception of direction. The sensitive cold receptors in the skin detect
the place where the nose is cooled the most and this is the direction a particular smell that the animal just
picked up comes from.[8]
In amphibians and lungfish, the nostrils open into small sacs that, in turn,
open into the forward roof of the mouth through the choanae. These sacs
contain a small amount of olfactory epithelium, which, in the case of
caecilians, also lines a number of neighbouring tentacles. Despite the
general similarity in structure to those of amphibians, the nostrils of
lungfish are not used in respiration, since these animals breathe through
their mouths. Amphibians also have a vomeronasal organ, lined by
olfactory epithelium, but, unlike those of amniotes, this is generally a
simple sac that, except in salamanders, has little connection with the rest of
the nasal system.[9]
In reptiles, the nasal chamber is generally larger, with the choanae located much further back in the roof of
the mouth. In crocodilians, the chamber is exceptionally long, helping the animal to breathe while partially
submerged. The reptilian nasal chamber is divided into three parts: an anterior vestibule, the main olfactory
chamber, and a posterior nasopharynx. The olfactory chamber is lined by olfactory epithelium on its upper
surface and possesses a number of turbinates to increase the sensory area. The vomeronasal organ is well-
developed in lizards and snakes, in which it no longer connects with the nasal cavity, opening directly into
the roof of the mouth. It is smaller in turtles, in which it retains its original nasal connection, and is absent in
adult crocodilians.[9]
Birds have a similar nose to reptiles, with the nostrils located at the upper rear part of the beak. Since they
generally have a poor sense of smell, the olfactory chamber is small, although it does contain three
turbinates, which sometimes have a complex structure similar to that of mammals. In many birds, including
doves and fowls, the nostrils are covered by a horny protective shield. The vomeronasal organ of birds is
either under-developed or altogether absent, depending on the species.[9]
The nasal cavities in mammals are both fused into one. Among
most species, they are exceptionally large, typically occupying up to
half the length of the skull. In some groups, however, including
primates, bats, and cetaceans, the nose has been secondarily
reduced, and these animals consequently have a relatively poor
sense of smell. The nasal cavity of mammals has been enlarged, in
part, by the development of a palate cutting off the entire upper
surface of the original oral cavity, which consequently becomes part
of the nose, leaving the palate as the new roof of the mouth. The
Sense of direction
Structure in air-breathing forms
enlarged nasal cavity contains complex turbinates forming coiled scroll-like shapes that help to warm the air
before it reaches the lungs. The cavity also extends into neighbouring skull bones, forming additional air
cavities known as paranasal sinuses.[9]
In cetaceans, the nose has been reduced to one or two blowholes, which are the nostrils that have migrated
to the top of the head. This adaptation gave cetaceans a more streamlined body shape and the ability to
breathe while mostly submerged. Conversely, the elephant's nose has elaborated into a long, muscular,
manipulative organ called the trunk.
The vomeronasal organ of mammals is generally similar to that of reptiles. In most species, it is located in
the floor of the nasal cavity, and opens into the mouth via two nasopalatine ducts running through the
palate, but it opens directly into the nose in many rodents. It is, however, lost in bats, and in many primates,
including humans.[9]
Fish have a relatively good sense of smell.[10] Unlike that of tetrapods, the nose has no connection with the
mouth, nor any role in respiration. Instead, it generally consists of a pair of small pouches located behind the
nostrils at the front or sides of the head. In many cases, each of the nostrils is divided into two by a fold of
skin, allowing water to flow into the nose through one side and out through the other.[9]
The pouches are lined by olfactory epithelium, and commonly include a series of internal folds to increase
the surface area, often forming an elaborate ""olfactory rosette"". In some teleosts, the pouches branch off into
additional sinus-like cavities, while in coelacanths, they form a series of tubes.[9]
In the earliest vertebrates, there was only one nostril and olfactory pouch, and the nasal passage was
connected to the hypophysis. The same anatomy is observed in the most primitive living vertebrates, the
lampreys and hagfish. In gnathostome ancestors, the olfactory apparatus gradually became paired
(presumably to allow sense of direction of smells), and freeing the midline from the nasal passage allowed
evolution of jaws.[11]

Anatomical terminology
Nostril
A nostril (or naris /'ne@rIs/, pl.: nares /'ne@ri:z/) is either of the
two orifices of the nose. They enable the entry and exit of air
and other gasses through the nasal cavities. In birds and
mammals, they contain branched bones or cartilages called
turbinates, whose function is to warm air on inhalation and
remove moisture on exhalation. Fish do not breathe through
noses, but they do have two small holes used for smelling,
which can also be referred to as nostrils (with the exception of
Cyclostomi, which have just one nostril).
In humans, the nasal cycle is the normal ultradian cycle of each
nostril's blood vessels becoming engorged in swelling, then
shrinking.
The nostrils are separated by the septum. The septum can
sometimes be deviated, causing one nostril to appear larger than
the other. With extreme damage to the septum and columella,
the two nostrils are no longer separated and form a single larger
external opening.
Like other tetrapods, humans have two external nostrils
(anterior nares) and two additional nostrils at the back of the
nasal cavity, inside the head (posterior nares, posterior nasal
apertures or choanae). They also connect the nose to the throat
(the nasopharynx), aiding in respiration. Though all four
nostrils were on the outside of the head of the aquatic ancestors
of modern tetrapods, the nostrils for outgoing water (excurrent
nostrils) migrated to the inside of the mouth, as evidenced by
the discovery of Kenichthys campbelli, a 395-million-year-old
fossilized fish which shows this migration in progress. It has
two nostrils between its front teeth, similar to human embryos at
an early stage. If these fail to join up, the result is a cleft
palate.[1]
Each external nostril contains approximately 1,000 strands of
nasal hair, which function to filter foreign particles such as
pollen and dust.[2]
It is possible for humans to smell different olfactory inputs in the two nostrils and experience a perceptual
rivalry akin to that of binocular rivalry when there are two different inputs to the two eyes.[3] Furthermore,
scent information from the two nostrils leads to two types of neural activity[4] with the first cycle
corresponding to the ipsilateral and the second cycle corresponding to the contralateral odor representations.
The Procellariiformes are distinguished from other birds by having tubular extensions of their nostrils.
Widely-spaced nostrils, like those of the hammerhead shark, may be useful in determining the direction of
an odour's source.[5][6]

Paranasal sinuses
Paranasal sinuses are a group of four paired air-filled
spaces that surround the nasal cavity.[1] The maxillary
sinuses are located under the eyes; the frontal sinuses
are above the eyes; the ethmoidal sinuses are between
the eyes and the sphenoidal sinuses are behind the eyes.
The sinuses are named for the facial bones and
sphenoid bone in which they are located. Their role is
disputed.
Humans possess four pairs of paranasal sinuses, divided
into subgroups that are named according to the bones
within which the sinuses lie. They are all innervated by
branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).
The maxillary sinuses, the largest of the
paranasal sinuses, are under the eyes, in the
maxillary bones (open in the back of the
semilunar hiatus of the nose). They are
innervated by the maxillary nerve (CN V2).[2]
The frontal sinuses, superior to the eyes, in
the frontal bone, which forms the hard part of
the forehead. They are innervated by the
ophthalmic nerve (CN V1).[2]
The ethmoidal sinuses, which are formed from
several discrete air cells within the ethmoid
bone between the nose and the eyes. They
are innervated by the ethmoidal nerves, which
branch from the nasociliary nerve of the
ophthalmic nerve (CN V1).
The sphenoidal sinuses, in the sphenoid
bone. They are innervated by the ophthalmic
and maxillary nerve (CN V1 and V2).[2]

Anatomical terminology
One known function of the paranasal sinuses is the
production of nitric oxide, which also functions as a
facilitator of oxygen uptake.[3]
Paranasal sinuses form developmentally through
excavation of bone by air-filled sacs (pneumatic
diverticula) from the nasal cavity. This process begins
prenatally (intrauterine life), and it continues through
the course of an organism's lifetime.
The results of experimental studies suggest that the
natural ventilation rate of a sinus with a single sinus ostium (opening) is extremely slow. Such limited
ventilation may be protective for the sinus, as it would help prevent drying of its mucosal surface and
maintain a near-sterile environment with high carbon dioxide concentrations and minimal pathogen access.
Thus composition of gas content in the maxillary sinus is similar to venous blood, with high carbon dioxide
and lower oxygen levels compared to breathing air.[4]
Development
At birth, only the maxillary sinus and the ethmoid sinus are developed but not yet pneumatized; only by the
age of seven they are fully aerated. The sphenoid sinus appears at the age of three, and the frontal sinuses
first appear at the age of six, and fully develop during adulthood.[5]

The paranasal sinuses are joined to the nasal cavity via small orifices called ostia. These become blocked
easily by allergic inflammation, or by swelling in the nasal lining that occurs with a cold. If this happens,
normal drainage of mucus within the sinuses is disrupted, and sinusitis may occur. Because the maxillary
posterior teeth are close to the maxillary sinus, this can also cause clinical problems if any disease processes
are present, such as an infection in any of these teeth. These clinical problems can include secondary
sinusitis, the inflammation of the sinuses from another source such as an infection of the adjacent teeth.[6]
These conditions may be treated with drugs such as decongestants, which cause vasoconstriction in the
sinuses; reducing inflammation; by traditional techniques of nasal irrigation; or by corticosteroid.

Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses comprise approximately 0.2% of all malignancies. About 80% of
these malignancies arise in the maxillary sinus. Men are much more often affected than women. They most
often occur in the age group between 40 and 70 years. Carcinomas are more frequent than sarcomas.
Metastases are rare. Tumours of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare.
Sinus is a Latin word meaning a fold, curve, or bay. Compare sine.
Paranasal sinuses occur in many other animals, including most mammals, birds, non-avian dinosaurs, and
crocodilians. The bones occupied by sinuses are quite variable in these other species.

Pharynx
The pharynx (pl.: pharynges) is the part of the throat behind
the mouth and nasal cavity, and above the esophagus and
trachea (the tubes going down to the stomach and the lungs
respectively). It is found in vertebrates and invertebrates,
though its structure varies across species. The pharynx carries
food to the esophagus and air to the larynx. The flap of
cartilage called the epiglottis stops food from entering the
larynx.
In humans, the pharynx is part of the digestive system and the
conducting zone of the respiratory system. (The conducting
zone--which also includes the nostrils of the nose, the larynx,
trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles--filters, warms and moistens
air and conducts it into the lungs).[1] The human pharynx is
conventionally divided into three sections: the nasopharynx,
oropharynx, and laryngopharynx.
In humans, two sets of pharyngeal muscles form the pharynx
and determine the shape of its lumen. They are arranged as an
inner layer of longitudinal muscles and an outer circular layer.
The upper portion of the pharynx, the nasopharynx, extends
from the base of the skull to the upper surface of the soft
palate.[2] It includes the space between the internal nares and
the soft palate and lies above the oral cavity. The adenoids, also
known as the pharyngeal tonsils, are lymphoid tissue structures
located in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Waldeyer's
tonsillar ring is an annular arrangement of lymphoid tissue in
both the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The nasopharynx is
lined by respiratory epithelium that is pseudostratified,
columnar, and ciliated.
Polyps or mucus can obstruct the nasopharynx, as can
congestion due to an upper respiratory infection. The auditory
tube, which connects the middle ear to the pharynx, opens into
the nasopharynx at the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube.

Details of torus tubarius
The opening and closing of the auditory tubes serves to
equalize the barometric pressure in the middle ear with that of
the ambient atmosphere.
The anterior aspect of the nasopharynx communicates through
the choanae with the nasal cavities. On its lateral wall is the
pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube, somewhat triangular
in shape and bounded behind by a firm prominence, the torus
tubarius or cushion, caused by the medial end of the cartilage of
the tube that elevates the mucous membrane. Two folds arise
from the cartilaginous opening:
the salpingopharyngeal fold, a vertical fold of
mucous membrane extending from the inferior part of
the torus and containing the salpingopharyngeus
muscle
the salpingopalatine fold, a smaller fold, in front of
the salpingopharyngeal fold, extending from the
superior part of the torus to the palate and containing
the levator veli palatini muscle. It also contains some
muscle fibres called salpingopalatine muscle[3] The
tensor veli palatini is lateral to the levator and does
not contribute to the fold, since the origin is deep to the
cartilaginous opening.
The oropharynx lies behind the oral cavity, extending from the
uvula to the level of the hyoid bone. It opens anteriorly, through the
isthmus faucium, into the mouth, while in its lateral wall, between
the palatoglossal arch and the palatopharyngeal arch, is the palatine
tonsil.[4] The anterior wall consists of the base of the tongue and the
epiglottic vallecula; the lateral wall is made up of the tonsil, tonsillar
fossa, and tonsillar (faucial) pillars; the superior wall consists of the
inferior surface of the soft palate and the uvula. Because both food
and air pass through the pharynx, a flap of connective tissue called
the epiglottis closes over the glottis when food is swallowed to
prevent aspiration. The oropharynx is lined by non-keratinized
squamous stratified epithelium.

Oropharynx
Laryngopharynx
Pharyngitis is the painful swelling of
the throat. The oropharynx shown
here is very inflamed and red.
The laryngopharynx, (Latin: pars laryngea pharyngis), also known as hypopharynx, is the caudal part of
the pharynx; it is the part of the throat that connects to the esophagus. It lies inferior to the epiglottis and
extends to the location where this common pathway diverges into the respiratory (laryngeal) and digestive
(esophageal) pathways. At that point, the laryngopharynx is continuous with the esophagus posteriorly. The
esophagus conducts food and fluids to the stomach; air enters the larynx anteriorly. During swallowing,
food has the ""right of way"", and air passage temporarily stops. Corresponding roughly to the area located
between the 4th and 6th cervical vertebrae, the superior boundary of the laryngopharynx is at the level of
the hyoid bone. The laryngopharynx includes three major sites: the pyriform sinus, postcricoid area, and the
posterior pharyngeal wall. Like the oropharynx above it, the laryngopharynx serves as a passageway for
food and air and is lined with a stratified squamous epithelium. It is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus
and by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
The vascular supply to the laryngopharynx includes the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the
ascending pharyngeal artery. The primary neural supply is from both the vagus and glossopharyngeal
nerves. The vagus nerve provides an auricular branch also termed ""Arnold's nerve"" which also supplies the
external auditory canal, thus laryngopharyngeal cancer can result in referred ear pain. This nerve is also
responsible for the ear-cough reflex in which stimulation of the ear canal results in a person coughing.
The pharynx moves food from the mouth to the esophagus. It also moves air from the nasal and oral cavities
to the larynx. It is also used in human speech, as pharyngeal consonants are articulated here, and it acts as a
resonating chamber during phonation.
Inflammation of the pharynx, or pharyngitis, is the painful
inflammation of the throat.
Pharyngeal cancer is a cancer that originates in the neck and/or
throat.
Waldeyer's tonsillar ring is an anatomical term collectively describing the annular arrangement of lymphoid
tissue in the pharynx. Waldeyer's ring circumscribes the naso- and oropharynx, with some of its tonsillar
tissue located above and some below the soft palate (and to the back of the oral cavity). It is believed that
Waldeyer's ring prevents the invasion of microorganisms from going into the air and food passages and this
helps in the defense mechanism of the respiratory and alimentary systems.[7]

Etymology
An illustration of the pharyngeal
jaws of a moray eel
The word pharynx (/'faerINGks/[8][9]) is derived from the Greek pharugx pharynx, meaning ""throat"". Its plural
form is pharynges /f@'rIndZi:z/ or pharynxes /'faerINGks@z/, and its adjective form is pharyngeal
(/,faerIn'dZi:@l/ or /f@'rIndZi@l/).
All vertebrates have a pharynx, used in both feeding and respiration. The pharynx arises during
development in all vertebrates through a series of six or more outpocketings on the lateral sides of the head.
These outpocketings are pharyngeal arches, and they give rise to a number of different structures in the
skeletal, muscular, and circulatory systems. The structure of the pharynx varies across the vertebrates. It
differs in dogs, horses, and ruminants. In dogs, a single duct connects the nasopharynx to the nasal cavity.
The tonsils are a compact mass that points away from the lumen of the pharynx. In the horse, the auditory
tube opens into the guttural pouch and the tonsils are diffuse and raised slightly. Horses are unable to
breathe through the mouth as the free apex of the rostral epiglottis lies dorsal to the soft palate in a normal
horse. In ruminants the tonsils are a compact mass that points towards the lumen of the pharynx.
Pharyngeal arches are characteristic features of vertebrates whose origin can be traced back through
chordates to basal deuterostomes who also share endodermal outpocketings of the pharyngeal apparatus.
Similar patterns of gene expression can be detected in the developing pharynx of amphioxi and
hemichordates. However, the vertebrate pharynx is unique in that it gives rise to endoskeletal support
through the contribution of neural crest cells.[10]
Pharyngeal jaws are a ""second set"" of jaws contained within the
pharynx of many species of fish, distinct from the primary (oral) jaws.
Pharyngeal jaws have been studied in moray eels where their specific
action is noted. When the moray bites prey, it first bites normally with
its oral jaws, capturing the prey. Immediately thereafter, the pharyngeal
jaws are brought forward and bite down on the prey to grip it; they
then retract, pulling the prey down the eel's esophagus, allowing it to
be swallowed.[11]
Invertebrates also have a pharynx. Invertebrates with a pharynx
include the tardigrades,[12] annelids and arthropods,[13] and the priapulids (which have an eversible
pharynx).[14]
The ""pharynx"" of the nematode worm is a muscular food pump in the head, triangular in cross-section, that
grinds food and transports it directly to the intestines. A one-way valve connects the pharynx to the
excretory canal.

38,"Pleural cavity
The pleural cavity, pleural space, or intrapleural space is the potential space between the pleurae of the
pleural sac that surrounds each lung. A small amount of serous pleural fluid is maintained in the pleural
cavity to enable lubrication between the membranes, and also to create a pressure gradient.[1]
The serous membrane that covers the surface of the lung is the visceral pleura and is separated from the
outer membrane, the parietal pleura, by just the film of pleural fluid in the pleural cavity. The visceral pleura
follows the fissures of the lung and the root of the lung structures. The parietal pleura is attached to the
mediastinum, the upper surface of the diaphragm, and to the inside of the ribcage.[1]
In humans, the left and right lungs are completely separated by the mediastinum, and there is no
communication between their pleural cavities. Therefore, in cases of a unilateral pneumothorax, the
contralateral lung will remain functioning normally unless there is a tension pneumothorax, which may shift
the mediastinum and the trachea, kink the great vessels and eventually collapse the contralateral
cardiopulmonary circulation.
The visceral pleura receives its blood supply from the parenchymal capillaries of the underlying lung, which
have input from both the pulmonary and the bronchial circulation. The parietal pleura receives its blood
supply from whatever structures underlying it, which can be branched from the aorta (intercostal, superior
phrenic and inferior phrenic arteries), the internal thoracic (pericardiacophrenic, anterior intercostal and
musculophrenic branches), or their anastomosis.
The visceral pleurae are innervated by splanchnic nerves from the pulmonary plexus, which also innervates
the lungs and bronchi. The parietal pleurae however, like their blood supplies, receive nerve supplies from
different sources. The costal pleurae (including the portion that bulges above the thoracic inlet) and the
periphery of the diaphragmatic pleurae are innervated by the intercostal nerves from the enclosing rib cage,
which branches off from the T1-T12 thoracic spinal cord. The mediastinal pleurae and central portions of
the diaphragmatic pleurae are innervated by the phrenic nerves. which branches off the C3-C5 cervcial
cord. Only the parietal pleurae contain somatosensory nerves and are capable of perceiving pain.
During the third week of embryogenesis, each lateral mesoderm splits into two layers. The dorsal layer joins
the overlying somites and ectoderm to form the somatopleure; and the ventral layer joins the underlying
endoderm to form the splanchnopleure.[2] The dehiscence of these two layers creates a fluid-filled cavity on
each side, and with the ventral infolding and the subsequent midline fusion of the trilaminar disc, forms a
pair of intraembryonic coeloms anterolaterally around the gut tube during the fourth week, with the
splanchnopleure on the inner cavity wall and the somatopleure on the outer cavity wall.
The cranial end of the intraembryonic coeloms fuse early to form a single cavity, which rotates invertedly
and apparently descends in front of the thorax, and is later encroached by the growing primordial heart as
the pericardial cavity. The caudal portions of the coeloms fuse later below the umbilical vein to become the

Anatomical terminology
larger peritoneal cavity, separated from the pericardial cavity by
the transverse septum. The two cavities communicate via a slim
pair of remnant coeloms adjacent to the upper foregut called the
pericardioperitoneal canal. During the fifth week, the
developing lung buds begin to invaginate into these canals,
creating a pair of enlarging cavities that encroach into the
surrounding somites and further displace the transverse septum
caudally -- namely the pleural cavities. The mesothelia pushed
out by the developing lungs arise from the splanchnopleure,
and become the visceral pleurae; while the other mesothelial
surfaces of the pleural cavities arise from the somatopleure, and
become the parietal pleurae.
The tissue separating the newly formed pleural cavities from the
pericardial cavity are known as the pericardiopleural
membranes, which later become the side walls of the fibrous
pericardium. The transverse septum and the displaced somites
fuse to form the pleuroperitoneal membranes, which separates
the pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity and later becomes
the diaphragm.
The pleural cavity, with its associated pleurae, aids optimal
functioning of the lungs during breathing. The pleural cavity
also contains pleural fluid, which acts as a lubricant and allows
the pleurae to slide effortlessly against each other during
respiratory movements.[3] Surface tension of the pleural fluid
also leads to close apposition of the lung surfaces with the chest
wall. This relationship allows for greater inflation of the alveoli
during breathing. The pleural cavity transmits movements of the
ribs muscles to the lungs, particularly during heavy breathing.
During inhalation the external intercostals contract, as does the
diaphragm. This causes the expansion of the chest wall, that
increases the volume of the lungs. A negative pressure is thus
created and inhalation occurs.
Pleural fluid is a serous fluid produced by the serous membrane
covering normal pleurae. Most fluid is produced by the
exudation in parietal circulation (intercostal arteries) via bulk
flow and reabsorbed by the lymphatic system.[4] Thus, pleural
fluid is produced and reabsorbed continuously. The composition and volume is regulated by mesothelial
cells in the pleura.[5] In a normal 70 kg human, a few milliliters of pleural fluid is always present within the
intrapleural space.[6] Larger quantities of fluid can accumulate in the pleural space only when the rate of
production exceeds the rate of reabsorption. Normally, the rate of reabsorption increases as a physiological

response to accumulating fluid, with the reabsorption rate increasing up to 40 times the normal rate before
significant amounts of fluid accumulate within the pleural space. Thus, a profound increase in the
production of pleural fluid--or some blocking of the reabsorbing lymphatic system--is required for fluid to
accumulate in the pleural space.
The hydrostatic equilibrium model, viscous flow model and capillary equilibrium model are the three
hypothesised models of circulation of pleural fluid.[7]
According to the viscous flow model, the intra pleural pressure gradient drives a downward viscous flow of
pleural fluid along the flat surfaces of ribs.The capillary equilibrium model states that the high negative
apical pleural pressure leads to a basal-to-apical gradient at the mediastinal pleural surface, leading to a fluid
flow directed up towards the apex (helped by the beating heart and ventilation in lungs).Thus the
recirculation of fluid occurs. Finally there's a traverse flow from margins to flat portion of ribs completes the
fluid circulation.[8][9]
Absorption occurs into lymphatic vessels at the level of the diaphragmatic pleura.[10]
A pathologic collection of pleural fluid is called a pleural effusion.
Mechanisms:
1. Lymphatic obstruction
2. Increased capillary permeability
3. Decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure
4. Increased capillary venous pressure
5. Increased negative intrapleural pressure
Pleural effusions are classified as exudative (high protein) or
transudative (low protein). Exudative pleural effusions are generally
caused by infections such as pneumonia (parapneumonic pleural
effusion), malignancy, granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis
or coccidioidomycosis, collagen vascular diseases, and other
inflammatory states. Transudative pleural effusions occur in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis or
nephrotic syndrome.
Localized pleural fluid effusion noted during pulmonary embolism (PE) results probably from increased
capillary permeability due to cytokine or inflammatory mediator release from the platelet-rich thrombi.[11]

When accumulation of pleural fluid is noted, cytopathologic evaluation of the fluid, as well as clinical
microscopy, microbiology, chemical studies, tumor markers, pH determination and other more esoteric tests
are required as diagnostic tools for determining the causes of this abnormal accumulation. Even the gross
appearance, color, clarity and odor can be useful tools in diagnosis. The presence of heart failure, infection
or malignancy within the pleural cavity are the most common causes that can be identified using this
approach.[13]
Clear straw-colored: If transudative, no further analysis needed. If exudative, additional
studies needed to determine cause (cytology, culture, biopsy).

Microscopy may show resident cells (mesothelial cells, inflammatory cells) of either benign or malignant
etiology. Evaluation by a cytopathologist is then performed and a morphologic diagnosis can be made.
Neutrophils are numerous in pleural empyema. If lymphocytes predominate and mesothelial cells are rare,
this is suggestive of tuberculosis. Mesothelial cells may also be decreased in cases of rheumatoid pleuritis or
post-pleurodesis pleuritis. Eosinophils are often seen if a patient has recently undergone prior pleural fluid
tap. Their significance is limited.[14]
Pleural fluid analysis

Microscopic appearance
If malignant cells are present, a pathologist may perform additional studies including immunohistochemistry
to determine the etiology of the malignancy.
Chemistry studies may be performed including pH, pleural fluid:serum protein ratio, LDH ratio, specific
gravity, cholesterol and bilirubin levels. These studies may help clarify the etiology of a pleural effusion
(exudative vs transudative). Amylase may be elevated in pleural effusions related to gastric/esophageal
perforations, pancreatitis or malignancy. Pleural effusions are classified as exudative (high protein) or
transudative (low protein).
In spite of all the diagnostic tests available today, many pleural effusions remain idiopathic in origin. If
severe symptoms persist, more invasive techniques may be required. In spite of the lack of knowledge of
the cause of the effusion, treatment may be required to relieve the most common symptom, dyspnea, as this
can be quite disabling. Thoracoscopy has become the mainstay of invasive procedures as closed pleural
biopsy has fallen into disuse.
Diseases of the pleural cavity include:
Pneumothorax: a collection of air within the pleural cavity
Pleural effusion: a fluid accumulation within the pleural space.
Pleural tumors: abnormal growths on the pleurae.

Anatomical terminology
Pulmonary alveolus
A pulmonary alveolus (pl.: alveoli, from Latin alveolus, ""little
cavity""), also known as an air sac or air space, is one of
millions of hollow, distensible cup-shaped cavities in the lungs
where pulmonary gas exchange takes place.[1] Oxygen is
exchanged for carbon dioxide at the blood-air barrier between
the alveolar air and the pulmonary capillary.[2] Alveoli make up
the functional tissue of the mammalian lungs known as the lung
parenchyma, which takes up 90 percent of the total lung
volume.[3][4]
Alveoli are first located in the respiratory bronchioles that mark
the beginning of the respiratory zone. They are located sparsely
in these bronchioles, line the walls of the alveolar ducts, and are
more numerous in the blind-ended alveolar sacs.[5] The acini
are the basic units of respiration, with gas exchange taking
place in all the alveoli present.[6] The alveolar membrane is the
gas exchange surface, surrounded by a network of capillaries.
Oxygen is diffused across the membrane into the capillaries and
carbon dioxide is released from the capillaries into the alveoli to
be breathed out.[7][8]
Alveoli are particular to mammalian lungs. Different structures
are involved in gas exchange in other vertebrates.[9]
The alveoli are first located in the respiratory bronchioles as
scattered outpockets, extending from their lumens. The
respiratory bronchioles run for considerable lengths and
become increasingly alveolated with side branches of alveolar
ducts that become deeply lined with alveoli. The ducts number
between two and eleven from each bronchiole.[10] Each duct
opens into five or six alveolar sacs into which clusters of
alveoli open.
Each terminal respiratory unit is called an acinus and consists of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts,
alveolar sacs, and alveoli. New alveoli continue to form until the age of eight years.[5]

A histologic slide of a human alveolar
sac
A typical pair of human lungs contains about 480
million alveoli,[11] providing a total surface area for
gas exchange of between 70 and 80 square
metres.[10] Each alveolus is wrapped in a fine mesh
of capillaries covering about 70% of its area.[12] The
diameter of an alveolus is between 200 and 500
mm.[12]
An alveolus consists of an epithelial layer of simple
squamous epithelium (very thin, flattened cells),[13]
and an extracellular matrix surrounded by capillaries.
The epithelial lining is part of the alveolar membrane,
also known as the respiratory membrane, that allows
the exchange of gases. The membrane has several
layers - a layer of alveolar lining fluid that contains
surfactant, the epithelial layer and its basement
membrane; a thin interstitial space between the epithelial lining and the capillary membrane; a capillary
basement membrane that often fuses with the alveolar basement membrane, and the capillary endothelial
membrane. The whole membrane however is only between 0.2 mm at its thinnest part and 0.6 mm at its
thickest.[14]
In the alveolar walls there are interconnecting air passages between the alveoli known as the pores of
Kohn. The alveolar septum that separates the alveoli in the alveolar sac contains some collagen fibers and
elastic fibers. The septa also house the enmeshed capillary network that surrounds each alveolus.[3] The
elastic fibres allow the alveoli to stretch when they fill with air during inhalation. They then spring back
during exhalation in order to expel the carbon dioxide-rich air.
There are three major types of alveolar cell. Two types are
pneumocytes or pneumonocytes known as type I and type II cells
found in the alveolar wall, and a large phagocytic cell known as an
alveolar macrophage that moves about in the lumens of the alveoli,
and in the connective tissue between them. Type I cells, also called
type I pneumocytes, or type I alveolar cells, are squamous, thin and
flat and form the structure of the alveoli. Type II cells, also called
type II pneumocytes or type II alveolar cells, release pulmonary
surfactant to lower surface tension, and can also differentiate to
replace damaged type I cells.[12][15]
Development of the earliest structures that will contain alveoli begins on day 22 and is divided into five
stages: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar stage.[16] The alveolar stage begins
approximately 36 weeks into development. Immature alveoli appear as bulges from the sacculi which
invade the primary septa. As the sacculi develop, the protrusions in the primary septa become larger; new
septations are longer and thinner and are known as secondary septa.[16] Secondary septa are responsible for
Microanatomy
Development
An annotated diagram of the alveolus
The cross section of an alveolus with
capillaries is shown. Part of the
cross section is magnified to show
diffusion of oxygen gas and carbon
dioxide through type I cells and
capillary cells.
Gas exchange in the alveolus
the final division of the sacculi into alveoli. Majority of alveolar division occurs within the first 6 months but
continue to develop until 3 years of age. To create a thinner diffusion barrier, the double-layer capillary
network fuse into one network, each one closely associated with two alveoli as they develop.[16]
In the first three years of life, the enlargement of lungs is a consequence of the increasing number of alveoli;
after this point, both the number and size of alveoli increases until the development of lungs finishes at
approximately 8 years of age.[16]
Type I cells are the larger of the two cell types; they are thin, flat
epithelial lining cells (membranous pneumocytes), that form the
structure of the alveoli.[3] They are squamous (giving more surface
area to each cell) and have long cytoplasmic extensions that cover
more than 95% of the alveolar surface.[12][17]
Type I cells are involved in the process of gas exchange between
the alveoli and blood. These cells are extremely thin - sometimes
only 25 nm - the electron microscope was needed to prove that all
alveoli are lined with epithelium. This thin lining enables a fast
diffusion of gas exchange between the air in the alveoli and the
blood in the surrounding capillaries.
The nucleus of a type I cell occupies a large area of free cytoplasm
and its organelles are clustered around it reducing the thickness of
the cell. This also keeps the thickness of the blood-air barrier
reduced to a minimum.
The cytoplasm in the thin portion contains pinocytotic vesicles
which may play a role in the removal of small particulate
contaminants from the outer surface. In addition to desmosomes, all
type I alveolar cells have occluding junctions that prevent the
leakage of tissue fluid into the alveolar air space.
The relatively low solubility (and hence rate of diffusion) of oxygen
necessitates the large internal surface area (about 80 square m [96
square yards]) and very thin walls of the alveoli. Weaving between
the capillaries and helping to support them is an extracellular matrix,
a meshlike fabric of elastic and collagenous fibres. The collagen
fibres, being more rigid, give the wall firmness, while the elastic
fibres permit expansion and contraction of the walls during
breathing.
Function
Type I cells
Type I pneumocytes are unable to replicate and are susceptible to toxic insults. In the event of damage, type
II cells can proliferate and differentiate into type I cells to compensate.[18]
Type II cells are cuboidal and much smaller than type I cells.[3] They are the most numerous cells in the
alveoli, yet do not cover as much surface area as the squamous type I cells.[18] Type II cells (granulous
pneumocytes) in the alveolar wall contain secretory organelles known as lamellar bodies or lamellar
granules, that fuse with the cell membranes and secrete pulmonary surfactant. This surfactant is a film of
fatty substances, a group of phospholipids that reduce alveolar surface tension. The phospholipids are stored
in the lamellar bodies. Without this coating, the alveoli would collapse. The surfactant is continuously
released by exocytosis. Reinflation of the alveoli following exhalation is made easier by the surfactant,
which reduces surface tension in the thin fluid lining of the alveoli. The fluid coating is produced by the
body in order to facilitate the transfer of gases between blood and alveolar air, and the type II cells are
typically found at the blood-air barrier.[19][20]
Type II cells start to develop at about 26 weeks of gestation, secreting small amounts of surfactant.
However, adequate amounts of surfactant are not secreted until about 35 weeks of gestation - this is the
main reason for increased rates of infant respiratory distress syndrome, which drastically reduces at ages
above 35 weeks gestation.
Type II cells are also capable of cellular division, giving rise to more type I and II alveolar cells when the
lung tissue is damaged.[21]
MUC1, a human gene associated with type II pneumocytes, has been identified as a marker in lung
cancer.[22]
The importance of the type 2 lung alveolar cells in the development of severe respiratory symptoms of
COVID-19 and potential mechanisms on how these cells are protected by the SSRIs fluvoxamine and
fluoxetine was summarized in a review in April 2022.[23]
The alveolar macrophages reside on the internal luminal surfaces of the alveoli, the alveolar ducts, and the
bronchioles. They are mobile scavengers that serve to engulf foreign particles in the lungs, such as dust,
bacteria, carbon particles, and blood cells from injuries.[24] They are also called pulmonary macrophages,
and dust cells.
Insufficient surfactant in the alveoli is one of the causes that can contribute to atelectasis (collapse of part or
all of the lung). Without pulmonary surfactant, atelectasis is a certainty.[25] The severe condition of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of surfactant.[26]

Insufficient surfactant in the lungs of preterm infants causes infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS).
The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio is a measure of fetal amniotic fluid to indicate lung maturity or
immaturity.[27] A low ratio indicates a risk factor for IRDS. Lecithin and sphingomyelin are two of the
glycolipids of pulmonary surfactant.
Impaired surfactant regulation can cause an accumulation of surfactant proteins to build up in the alveoli in
a condition called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. This results in impaired gas exchange.[28]
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung tissue, which can be caused by both viruses and
bacteria. Cytokines and fluids are released into the alveolar cavity, interstitium, or both, in response to
infection, causing the effective surface area of gas exchange to be reduced. In severe cases where cellular
respiration cannot be maintained, supplemental oxygen may be required.[29][30]
Diffuse alveolar damage can be a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) a
severe inflammatory disease of the lung.[31]: 
187 
In asthma, the bronchioles become narrowed, causing the amount of air flow into the lung
tissue to be greatly reduced. It can be triggered by irritants in the air, photochemical smog for
example, as well as substances to which a person is allergic.
Chronic bronchitis occurs when an abundance of mucus is produced by the lungs. The
production of mucus occurs naturally when the lung tissue is exposed to irritants. In chronic
bronchitis, the air passages into the alveoli, the respiratory bronchioles, become clogged
with mucus. This causes increased coughing in order to remove the mucus, and is often a
result of extended periods of exposure to cigarette smoke.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
Almost any type of lung tumor or lung cancer can compress the
alveoli and reduce gas exchange capacity. In some cases the tumor
will fill the alveoli.[32]
Cavitary pneumonia is a process in which the alveoli are
destroyed and produce a cavity. As the alveoli are
destroyed, the surface area for gas exchange to occur
becomes reduced. Further changes in blood flow can
lead to decline in lung function.
Emphysema is another disease of the lungs, whereby
the elastin in the walls of the alveoli is broken down by
an imbalance between the production of neutrophil
elastase (elevated by cigarette smoke) and alpha-1
antitrypsin (the activity varies due to genetics or reaction
of a critical methionine residue with toxins including
cigarette smoke). The resulting loss of elasticity in the
lungs leads to prolonged times for exhalation, which
occurs through passive recoil of the expanded lung. This
leads to a smaller volume of gas exchanged per breath.
Inflammation
Structural
Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a rare lung disorder of small stone formation in the
alveoli.
A pulmonary contusion is a bruise of the lung tissue caused by trauma.[33] Damaged capillaries from a
contusion can cause blood and other fluids to accumulate in the tissue of the lung, impairing gas exchange.
Pulmonary edema is the buildup of fluid in the parenchyma and alveoli. An edema is usually caused by left
ventricular heart failure, or by damage to the lung or its vasculature.
Because of the high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in type II alveolar cells, the
lungs are susceptible to infections by some coronaviruses including the viruses that cause severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS)[34] and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[35]

Pulmonary pleurae
The pulmonary pleurae (sg.: pleura)[1] are the two flattened
sacs ensheathing each lung, locally appearing as two opposing
layers of serous membrane separating the lungs from the
mediastinum and the inside surfaces of the surrounding chest
walls.
The portion of the pleura that covers the surface of each lung is
often called the visceral pleura. This can lead to some
confusion, as the lung is not the only visceral organ covered by
the pleura. The pleura typically dips between the lobes of the
lung as fissures, and is formed by the invagination of lung buds
into each thoracic sac during embryonic development.[2] The
portion of the pleura seen as the outer layer covers the chest
wall and is often called the parietal pleura. It lines the inner
surfaces of the thoracic cavity on each side of the mediastinum,
and can be subdivided into mediastinal (covering the lateral
surfaces of the fibrous pericardium, oesophagus and thoracic
aorta), diaphragmatic (covering the upper surface of the
diaphragm), costal (covering the inside of rib cage) and cervical
(covering the underside of the suprapleural membrane) pleura.
The visceral and the mediastinal parietal pleurae are connected
at the root of the lung (""hilum"") through a smooth fold known
as pleural reflection, and a bell sleeve-like extension of visceral
pleura hanging under to the hilum is known as the pulmonary
ligament.
Between the two layers of the pleura is what historically has
been referred to as a potential space, which in reality is an
actual space of about 15 mm. This is called the pleural cavity
(also pleural space).[2] It contains a tiny amount of serous fluid
(pleural fluid) secreted by the pleurae, at a pressure below the
atmospheric pressure under healthy conditions. The two lungs,
each bounded by a two-layered pleural sac, almost fill the
thoracic cavity.
Each pleura comprises a superficial serosa made of a simple
monolayer of flat (squamous) or cuboidal mesothelial cells with
microvilli up to 6  mm (0.00024  in) long. The mesothelium is
without basement membrane, and supported by a well-
vascularized underlying loose connective tissue containing two

poorly defined layers of elastin-rich laminae. The costal parietal
pleurae also have adipocytes in the subserosa, which present as
subpleural/extrapleural fats and are histologically considered
belonging to the endothoracic fascia that separates the
subserosa from the inner periosteum of the ribs. Both pleurae
are quite firmly attached to their underlying structures, and are
usually covered by surface glycocalyces that limit fluid loss and
reduce friction.
The enclosed space between the parietal and visceral pleurae,
known as the pleural space, is normally filled only by a tiny
amount (less than 10  mL or 0.34  US  fl  oz) of serous fluid
secreted from the apical region of the parietal pleura. The
combination of surface tension, oncotic pressure, and the fluid
pressure drop caused by the inward elastic recoil of the lung
parenchyma and the rigidity of the chest wall, results in a normally
negative pressure of -5  cmH2O (approximately -3.68  mmHg or
-0.491  kPa) within the pleural space, causing it to mostly stay
collapsed as a potential space that acts as a functionally vacuumous
interface between the parietal and visceral pleurae. Contracting the
respiratory muscles expands the chest cavity, causing the attached
parietal pleura to also expand outwards. If the pleural functional
vacuum stays intact, the pleural space will remain as collapsed as
possible and cause the visceral pleura to be pulled along outwards,
which in turn draws the underlying lung also into expansion. This
transmits the pressure negativity into the alveoli and bronchioli, thus
facilitating inhalation.[4][5]
The visceral pleura (from Latin: viscera, lit. 'organ') covers the lung
surfaces and the hilar structures and extends caudally from the
hilum as a mesentery-like band called the pulmonary ligament.
Each lung is divided into lobes by the infoldings of the pleura as
fissures. The fissures are double folds of pleura that section the
lungs and help in their expansion,[6] allowing the lung to ventilate
more effectively even if parts of it (usually the basal segments) fail
to expand properly due to congestion or consolidation.The function
of the visceral pleura is to produce and reabsorb fluid.[7] It is an area that is insensitive to pain due to its
association with the lung and innervation by visceral sensory neurons.[8]
Visceral pleura also forms interlobular septa (that separates secondary pulmonary lobules).[9] Interlobular
septa contains connective tissue, pulmonary veins, and lymphatics.[10]
Visceral pleura
Parietal pleura
The parietal pleura (from Latin: paries, lit. 'wall') lines the inside of the thoracic cavity which is set apart
from the thoracic wall by the endothoracic fascia. The Parietal includes the inner surface of the rib cage and
the upper surface of the diaphragm, as well as the side surfaces of the mediastinum, from which it separates
the pleural cavity. It joins the visceral pleura at the pericardial base of the pulmonary hilum and pulmonary
ligament as a smooth but acutely angled circumferential junction known as the hilar reflection.[11]
The parietal pleura is subdivided according to the surface it covers.
The costal pleura is the pleural portion covering the inner surfaces of the rib cage, and is
separated from the ribs/cartilages and intercostal muscles by the endothoracic fascia.
The apical part of the costal pleura, sometimes referred to as the cervical pleura or
cupula of pleura, bulges beyond the thoracic inlet into the posterior triangle of the neck,
where it is covered by an extension of the endothoracic fascia known as the suprapleural
membrane. This is the most superficial (and thus most vulnerable) part of the pleura and
can be punctured by subclavian catheterization or a penetrating neck injury.
The diaphragmatic pleura is the portion covering the convex upper surface of the diaphragm.
Its junction with the costal pleura at the diaphragmatic margin is a sharp gutter known as the
costodiaphragmatic recess, which has diagnostic significance on plain radiography.
The mediastinal pleura is the portion covering the lateral surfaces of the mediastinum,
predominantly the fibrous pericardium, the thoracic aorta, the first part of the subclavian
artery, the superior vena cava/azygos vein, the esophagus and (very rarely) an enlarged
thymus. Its anterosuperior part (especially of the left side) not infrequently can bulge into the
anterior mediastinum behind the upper sternal body and even touch its contralateral
counterpart in forced inhalation, but the left and right pleurae do not communicate unless
there is a significant injury (traumatic or iatrogenic) or disease process (e.g. malignancy).
As a rule of thumb, the blood and nerve supply of a pleura comes from the structures under it. The visceral
pleura is supplied by the capillaries that supply the lung surface (from both the pulmonary circulation and
the bronchial vessels), and innervated by the nerve endings from the pulmonary plexus.
The parietal pleura is supplied by blood from the cavity wall under it, which can come from the aorta
(intercostal, superior phrenic and inferior phrenic arteries), the internal thoracic arteries (pericardiacophrenic,
anterior intercostal and musculophrenic branches), or their anastomoses. Similarly, its nerve supply is from
its underlying structures -- the costal pleura is innervated by the intercostal nerves; the diaphragmatic pleura
is innervated by the phrenic nerve in its central portion around the central tendon, and by the intercostal
nerves in its periphery near the costal margin; the mediastinal pleura is innervated by branches of the
phrenic nerve over the fibrous pericardium.[12]
The visceral and parietal pleurae, like all mesothelia, both derive from the lateral plate mesoderms. During
the third week of embryogenesis, each lateral mesoderm splits into two layers. The dorsal layer joins
overlying somites and ectoderm to form the somatopleure; and the ventral layer joins the underlying
endoderm to form the splanchnopleure.[13] The dehiscence of these two layers creates a fluid-filled cavity
on each side, and with the ventral infolding and the subsequent midline fusion of the trilaminar disc, forms a
pair of intraembryonic coeloms anterolaterally around the gut tube during the fourth week, with the
splanchnopleure on the inner cavity wall and the somatopleure on the outer cavity wall.
Neurovascular supply
Development
The cranial end of the intraembryonic coeloms fuse early to form a single cavity, which rotates anteriorly
and apparently descends inverted in front of the thorax, and is later encroached by the growing primordial
heart as the pericardial cavity. The caudal portions of the coeloms fuse later below the umbilical vein to
become the larger peritoneal cavity, separated from the pericardial cavity by the transverse septum. The two
cavities communicate via a slim pair of remnant coeloms adjacent to the upper foregut called the
pericardioperitoneal canal. During the fifth week, the developing lung buds begin to invaginate into these
canals, creating a pair of enlarging cavities that encroach into the surrounding somites and further displace
the transverse septum caudally -- namely the pleural cavities. The mesothelia pushed out by the developing
lungs arise from the splanchnopleure, and become the visceral pleurae; while the other mesothelial surfaces
of the pleural cavities arise from the somatopleure, and become the parietal pleurae.
As a serous membrane, the pleura secretes a serous fluid (pleural fluid) that contains various lubricating
macromolecules such as sialomucin, hyaluronan and phospholipids. These, coupled with the smoothness of
the glycocalyces and hydrodynamic lubrication of the pleural fluid itself, reduces the frictional coefficient
when the opposing pleural surfaces have to slide against each other during ventilation, thus help improving
the pulmonary compliance.
The adhesive property of the pleural fluid to various cellular surfaces, coupled with its oncotic pressure and
the negative fluid pressure, also holds the two opposing pleurae in close sliding contact and keeps the
pleural space collapsed, maximizing the total lung capacity while maintaining a functional vacuum. When
inhalation occurs, the contraction of the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles (along with the
bucket/pump handle movements of the ribs and sternum) increases the volume of the pleural cavity, further
increasing the negative pressure within the pleural space. As long as the functional vacuum remains intact,
the lung will be drawn to expand along with the chest wall, relaying a negative airway pressure that causes
an airflow into the lung, resulting in inhalation. Exhalation is however usually passive, caused by elastic
recoil of the alveolar walls and relaxation of respiratory muscles. In forced exhalation, the pleural fluid
provides some hydrostatic cushioning for the lungs against the rapid change of pressure within the pleural
cavity.
Pleuritis or pleurisy is a inflammatory condition of pleurae. Due to the somatic innervation of the parietal
pleura, pleural irritations, especially if from acute causes, often produce a sharp chest pain that is worse by
breathing, known as pleuritic pain.
Pleural disease or lymphatic blockages can lead to a build-up of serous fluid within the pleural space,
known as a pleural effusion. Pleural effusion obliterates the pleural vacuum and can collapse the lung (due
to hydrostatic pressure), impairing ventilation and leading to type 2 respiratory failure. The condition can be
treated by mechanically removing the fluid via thoracocentesis (also known as a ""pleural tap"") with a pigtail

catheter, a chest tube, or a thoracoscopic procedure. Infected pleural effusion can lead to pleural empyema,
which can create significant adhesion and fibrosis that require division and decortication. For recurrent
pleural effusions, pleurodesis can be performed to establish permanent obliteration of the pleural space.[14]

Anatomical terminology
Respiratory system
The respiratory system (also respiratory apparatus,
ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific
organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and
plants. The anatomy and physiology that make this happen
varies greatly, depending on the size of the organism, the
environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In
land animals, the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of
the lungs.[1] Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of
small air sacs; in mammals and reptiles, these are called alveoli,
and in birds, they are known as atria. These microscopic air
sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into
close contact with the blood.[2] These air sacs communicate
with the external environment via a system of airways, or
hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which
branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi.
These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively
narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into
numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds, the
bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or
parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in
mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from the
environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing
which involves the muscles of respiration.
In most fish, and a number of other aquatic animals (both
vertebrates and invertebrates), the respiratory system consists of
gills, which are either partially or completely external organs,
bathed in the watery environment. This water flows over the
gills by a variety of active or passive means. Gas exchange
takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat
filaments and lammellae which expose a very large surface area
of highly vascularized tissue to the water.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with
very simple anatomical features, and in amphibians, even the
skin plays a vital role in gas exchange. Plants also have

respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals. The respiratory
system in plants includes anatomical features such as stomata, that are found in various parts of the plant.[3]
In humans and other mammals, the anatomy of a
typical respiratory system is the respiratory tract. The tract is divided into an upper and a lower respiratory
tract. The upper tract includes the nose, nasal cavities, sinuses, pharynx and the part of the larynx above the
vocal folds. The lower tract (Fig. 2.) includes the lower part of the larynx, the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles
and the alveoli.
The branching airways of the lower tract are often described as the respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree
(Fig. 2).[4] The intervals between successive branch points along the various branches of ""tree"" are often
referred to as branching ""generations"", of which there are, in the adult human, about 23. The earlier
generations (approximately generations 0-16), consisting of the trachea and the bronchi, as well as the
larger bronchioles which simply act as air conduits, bringing air to the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar
ducts and alveoli (approximately generations 17-23), where gas exchange takes place.[5][6] Bronchioles are
defined as the small airways lacking any cartilaginous support.[4]
The first bronchi to branch from the trachea are the right and left main bronchi. Second, only in diameter to
the trachea (1.8 cm), these bronchi (1 -1.4 cm in diameter)[5] enter the lungs at each hilum, where they
branch into narrower secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary

bronchi known as segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi (1 to 6 mm in diameter)[7]
are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental
bronchi.[8][9]
Compared to the 23 number (on average) of branchings of the respiratory tree in the adult human, the
mouse has only about 13 such branchings.
The alveoli are the dead end terminals of the ""tree"", meaning that any air that enters them has to exit via the
same route. A system such as this creates dead space, a volume of air (about 150 ml in the adult human) that
fills the airways after exhalation and is breathed back into the alveoli before environmental air reaches
them.[10][11] At the end of inhalation, the airways are filled with environmental air, which is exhaled
without coming in contact with the gas exchanger.[10]
The lungs expand and contract during the breathing cycle, drawing air in and out of the lungs. The volume
of air moved in or out of the lungs under normal resting circumstances (the resting tidal volume of about
500  ml), and volumes moved during maximally forced inhalation and maximally forced exhalation are
measured in humans by spirometry.[12] A typical adult human spirogram with the names given to the
various excursions in volume the lungs can undergo is illustrated below (Fig. 3):
Not all the air in the lungs can be expelled during maximally forced exhalation(ERV). This is the residual
volume(volume of air remaining even after a forced exhalation) of about 1.0-1.5 liters which cannot be
measured by spirometry. Volumes that include the residual volume (i.e. functional residual capacity of about
2.5-3.0 liters, and total lung capacity of about 6 liters) can therefore also not be measured by spirometry.
Their measurement requires special techniques.[12]

The rates at which air is breathed in or out, either through the mouth or nose or into or out of the alveoli are
tabulated below, together with how they are calculated. The number of breath cycles per minute is known
as the respiratory rate. An average healthy human breathes 12-16 times a minute.

In mammals, inhalation at rest is primarily due to the contraction of
the diaphragm. This is an upwardly domed sheet of muscle that
separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it
contracts, the sheet flattens, (i.e. moves downwards as shown in
Fig. 7) increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity in the antero-
posterior axis. The contracting diaphragm pushes the abdominal
organs downwards. But because the pelvic floor prevents the
lowermost abdominal organs from moving in that direction, the
pliable abdominal contents cause the belly to bulge outwards to the
front and sides, because the relaxed abdominal muscles do not resist
this movement (Fig. 7). This entirely passive bulging (and shrinking
during exhalation) of the abdomen during normal breathing is
sometimes referred to as ""abdominal breathing"", although it is, in
fact, ""diaphragmatic breathing"", which is not visible on the outside
of the body. Mammals only use their abdominal muscles during
forceful exhalation (see Fig. 8, and discussion below). Never during
any form of inhalation.
As the diaphragm contracts, the rib cage is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs being pulled upwards by the
intercostal muscles as shown in Fig. 4. All the ribs slant downwards from the rear to the front (as shown in
Fig. 4); but the lowermost ribs also slant downwards from the midline outwards (Fig. 5). Thus the rib cage's
transverse diameter can be increased in the same way as the antero-posterior diameter is increased by the so-
called pump handle movement shown in Fig. 4.
The enlargement of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two
horizontal dimensions by the lifting of the front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall.
The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space,
pleura fluid between double-layered pleura covering of lungs helps in reducing friction while lungs
expansion and contraction. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways (Fig. 2). In a
healthy person, these airways begin with the nose.[13][14] (It is possible to begin with the mouth, which is
the backup breathing system. However, chronic mouth breathing leads to, or is a sign of, illness.[15][16][17])
It ends in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli, which are always open, though the diameters of the
various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The alveolar air

pressure is therefore always close to
atmospheric air pressure (about 100 kPa
at sea level) at rest, with the pressure
gradients because of lungs contraction
and expansion cause air to move in and
out of the lungs during breathing rarely
exceeding 2-3 kPa.[18][19]
During exhalation, the diaphragm and
intercostal muscles relax. This returns
the chest and abdomen to a position
determined 
by 
their 
anatomical
elasticity. This is the ""resting mid-
position"" of the thorax and abdomen
(Fig.  7) when the lungs contain their
functional residual capacity of air (the
light blue area in the right hand
illustration of Fig. 7), which in the adult
human has a volume of about 2.5-
3.0 liters (Fig. 3).[6] Resting exhalation
lasts about twice as long as inhalation
because the diaphragm relaxes passively
more gently than it contracts actively
during inhalation.
The volume of air that moves in or out
(at the nose or mouth) during a single
breathing cycle is called the tidal
volume. In a resting adult human, it is
about 500 ml per breath. At the end of
exhalation, the airways contain about
150 ml of alveolar air which is the first
air that is breathed back into the alveoli
during inhalation.[10][20] This volume
air that is breathed out of the alveoli and
back in again is known as dead space
ventilation, which has the consequence
that of the 500  ml breathed into the
alveoli with each breath only 350  ml
(500  ml - 150  ml = 350  ml) is fresh
warm and moistened air.[6] Since this
350 ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after a normal
exhalation (i.e. the functional residual capacity of about 2.5-3.0 liters), it is clear that the composition of the
alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial
pressure) remains close to 13-14 kPa (about 100 mm Hg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3 kPa
(or 40 mm Hg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure
of oxygen is 21 kPa (or 160 mm Hg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04 kPa (or 0.3 mmHg).[6]
Breathing
Fig. 7 The muscles of breathing
at rest: inhalation on the left,
exhalation on the right.
Contracting muscles are shown in
red; relaxed muscles in blue.
Contraction of the diaphragm
generally contributes the most to
the expansion of the chest cavity
(light blue). However, at the same
time, the intercostal muscles pull
the ribs upwards (their effect is
indicated by arrows) also causing
the rib cage to expand during
inhalation (see diagram on other
side of the page). The relaxation
of all these muscles during
exhalation causes the rib cage
and abdomen (light green) to
elastically return to their resting
positions. Compare with Fig. 6,
the MRI video of the chest
movements during the breathing
cycle.
Fig. 8 The muscles of forceful
breathing (inhalation and
exhalation). The color code is the
same as on the left. In addition to
a more forceful and extensive
contraction of the diaphragm, the
intercostal muscles are aided by
the accessory muscles of
inhalation to exaggerate the
movement of the ribs upwards,
causing a greater expansion of
the rib cage. During exhalation,
apart from the relaxation of the
muscles of inhalation, the
abdominal muscles actively
contract to pull the lower edges of
the rib cage downwards
decreasing the volume of the rib
cage, while at the same time
pushing the diaphragm upwards
deep into the thorax.
During heavy breathing (hyperpnea),
as, for instance, during exercise,
inhalation is brought about by a more
powerful and greater excursion of the
contracting diaphragm than at rest
(Fig. 8). In addition, the ""accessory
muscles of inhalation"" exaggerate the
actions of the intercostal muscles (Fig.
8). These accessory muscles of
inhalation are muscles that extend
from the cervical vertebrae and base
of the skull to the upper ribs and
sternum, 
sometimes 
through 
an
intermediary 
attachment 
to 
the
clavicles.[6] When they contract, the
rib cage's internal volume is increased
to a far greater extent than can be
achieved by contraction of the
intercostal muscles alone. Seen from
outside the body, the lifting of the
clavicles during strenuous or labored
inhalation 
is 
sometimes 
called
clavicular breathing, seen especially
during asthma attacks and in people
with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
During heavy breathing, exhalation is
caused by relaxation of all the
muscles of inhalation. But now, the
abdominal 
muscles, 
instead 
of
remaining relaxed (as they do at rest),
contract forcibly pulling the lower edges of the rib cage downwards (front and sides) (Fig. 8). This not only
drastically decreases the size of the rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the
diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax (Fig. 8). The end-exhalatory lung volume is
now well below the resting mid-position and contains far less air than the resting ""functional residual
capacity"". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human, there
is always still at least 1 liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.[6]
The automatic rhythmical breathing in and out, can be interrupted by coughing, sneezing (forms of very
forceful exhalation), by the expression of a wide range of emotions (laughing, sighing, crying out in pain,
exasperated intakes of breath) and by such voluntary acts as speech, singing, whistling and the playing of
wind instruments. All of these actions rely on the muscles described above, and their effects on the
movement of air in and out of the lungs.

normal breathing cycle at rest. The scale on the left, and the blue
line, indicate the partial pressures of carbon dioxide in kPa, while
that on the right and the red line, indicate the partial pressures of
oxygen, also in kPa (to convert kPa into mm Hg, multiply by 7.5).
Although not a form of breathing, the
Valsalva 
maneuver 
involves 
the
respiratory muscles. It is, in fact, a very
forceful exhalatory effort against a
tightly closed glottis, so that no air can
escape from the lungs.[21] Instead,
abdominal contents are evacuated in
the opposite direction, through orifices
in the pelvic floor. The abdominal
muscles contract very powerfully,
causing 
the 
pressure 
inside 
the
abdomen and thorax to rise to
extremely high levels. The Valsalva
maneuver 
can 
be 
carried 
out
voluntarily but is more generally a
reflex elicited when attempting to
empty 
the 
abdomen 
during, 
for
instance, difficult defecation, or during
childbirth. Breathing ceases during this
maneuver.
The primary purpose of the respiratory system is the equalizing of the partial pressures of the respiratory
gases in the alveolar air with those in the pulmonary capillary blood (Fig. 11). This process occurs by
simple diffusion,[22] across a very thin membrane (known as the blood-air barrier), which forms the walls
of the pulmonary alveoli (Fig. 10). It consists of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and
the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries (Fig. 10).[23] This blood gas barrier is extremely thin (in
humans, on average, 2.2 mm thick). It is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli[23] (each
between 75 and 300  mm in diameter) branching off from the respiratory bronchioles in the lungs, thus
providing an extremely large surface area (approximately 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.[23]
The air contained within the alveoli has a semi-permanent volume of about 2.5-3.0 liters which completely
surrounds the alveolar capillary blood (Fig. 12). This ensures that equilibration of the partial pressures of the
gases in the two compartments is very efficient and occurs very quickly. The blood leaving the alveolar
capillaries and is eventually distributed throughout the body therefore has a partial pressure of oxygen of
13-14 kPa (100 mmHg), and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg) (i.e. the same as
the oxygen and carbon dioxide gas tensions as in the alveoli).[6] As mentioned in the section above, the
corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are
21 kPa (160 mmHg) and 0.04 kPa (0.3 mmHg) respectively.[6]
This marked difference between the composition of the alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be
maintained because the functional residual capacity is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside
air by fairly narrow and relatively long tubes (the airways: nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and their
branches down to the bronchioles), through which the air has to be breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no
unidirectional through-flow as there is in the bird lung). This typical mammalian anatomy combined with
the fact that the lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a substantial volume of air,

of about
2.5-
3.0  liters,
in 
the
alveoli
after
exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is
only minimally disturbed when the 350  ml of fresh air is
mixed into it with each inhalation. Thus the animal is provided
with a very special ""portable atmosphere"", whose composition
differs significantly from the present-day ambient air.[24] It is
this portable atmosphere (the functional residual capacity) to
which the blood and therefore the body tissues are exposed -
not to the outside air.
The resulting arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon
dioxide are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial
partial pressure of CO2 and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the
arterial partial pressure of O2, will reflexly cause deeper and
faster breathing until the blood gas tensions in the lungs, and
therefore the arterial blood, return to normal. The converse
happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a
lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of
breathing are reduced until blood gas normality is restored.
Since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial
pressure of O2 of, on average, 6 kPa (45 mmHg), while the
pressure in the alveolar air is 13-14 kPa (100 mmHg), there
will be a net diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood,
changing the composition of the 3 liters of alveolar air slightly.
Similarly, since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries
has a partial pressure of CO2 of also about 6 kPa (45 mmHg),
pulmonary capillaries contain about 100
ml of blood.
whereas that of the alveolar air is 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg), there is
a net movement of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries into
the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net flows of
individual gases into and out of the alveolar air necessitate the
replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every 5 seconds or so. This is very tightly
controlled by the monitoring of the arterial blood gases (which accurately reflect composition of the alveolar
air) by the aortic and carotid bodies, as well as by the blood gas and pH sensor on the anterior surface of the
medulla oblongata in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they
primarily determine the diameters of the bronchioles and pulmonary capillaries, and are therefore
responsible for directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.
It is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the 3 liters of alveolar air that with each
breath some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the
outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, respiration
will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3 kPa
(40 mmHg). It is therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory system is to
rid the body of carbon dioxide ""waste"". The carbon dioxide that is breathed out with each breath could
probably be more correctly be seen as a byproduct of the body's extracellular fluid carbon dioxide and pH
homeostats
If these homeostats are compromised, then a respiratory acidosis, or a respiratory alkalosis will occur. In the
long run these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO3
- concentrations in the
plasma; but since this takes time, the hyperventilation syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or
anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the
blowing off of too much CO2 from the blood into the outside air.[25]
Oxygen has a very low solubility in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with
hemoglobin. The oxygen is held on the hemoglobin by four ferrous iron-containing heme groups per
hemoglobin molecule. When all the heme groups carry one O2 molecule each the blood is said to be
""saturated"" with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will meaningfully
increase the oxygen concentration of the blood. Most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried as
bicarbonate ions (HCO3
-) in the plasma. However the conversion of dissolved CO2 into HCO3
- (through
the addition of water) is too slow for the rate at which the blood circulates through the tissues on the one
hand, and through alveolar capillaries on the other. The reaction is therefore catalyzed by carbonic
anhydrase, an enzyme inside the red blood cells.[26] The reaction can go in both directions depending on
the prevailing partial pressure of CO2.[6] A small amount of carbon dioxide is carried on the protein portion
of the hemoglobin molecules as carbamino groups. The total concentration of carbon dioxide (in the form of
bicarbonate ions, dissolved CO2, and carbamino groups) in arterial blood (i.e. after it has equilibrated with
the alveolar air) is about 26  mM (or 58  ml/100 ml),[27] compared to the concentration of oxygen in
saturated arterial blood of about 9 mM (or 20 ml/100 ml blood).[6]
Ventilation of the lungs in mammals occurs via the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and the pons
of the brainstem.[6] These areas form a series of neural pathways which receive information about the
partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This information determines the
Control of ventilation

pressure and altitude above sea level.
average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep these pressures constant. The respiratory
center does so via motor nerves which activate the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration.
The breathing rate increases when the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood increases. This is
detected by central blood gas chemoreceptors on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata.[6] The aortic
and carotid bodies, are the peripheral blood gas chemoreceptors which are particularly sensitive to the
arterial partial pressure of O2 though they also respond, but less strongly, to the partial pressure of CO2.[6]
At sea level, under normal circumstances, the breathing rate and depth, is determined primarily by the
arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide rather than by the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, which is
allowed to vary within a fairly wide range before the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons
respond to it to change the rate and depth of breathing.[6]
Exercise increases the breathing rate due to the extra carbon dioxide produced by the enhanced metabolism
of the exercising muscles.[28] In addition, passive movements of the limbs also reflexively produce an
increase in the breathing rate.[6][28]
Information received from stretch receptors in the lungs' limits tidal volume (the depth of inhalation and
exhalation).
The alveoli are open (via the airways) to the atmosphere, with the result that alveolar air pressure is exactly
the same as the ambient air pressure at sea level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving
chamber, or decompression chamber) in which the individual is breathing freely. With expansion of the
lungs the alveolar air occupies a larger volume, and its pressure falls proportionally, causing air to flow in
through the airways, until the pressure in the alveoli is again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse
happens during exhalation. This process (of inhalation and exhalation) is exactly the same at sea level, as on
top of Mt. Everest, or in a diving chamber or decompression chamber.
However, as one rises above sea level
the density of the air decreases
exponentially (see Fig.  14), halving
approximately with every 5500 m rise
in altitude.[29] Since the composition of
the atmospheric air is almost constant
below 80  km, as a result of the
continuous 
mixing 
effect 
of 
the
weather, the concentration of oxygen
in the air (mmols O2 per liter of
ambient air) decreases at the same rate
as the fall in air pressure with
altitude.[30] Therefore, in order to
breathe in the same amount of oxygen
per minute, the person has to inhale a
proportionately greater volume of air
Responses to low atmospheric pressures

south, behind Nuptse and Lhotse.
per minute at altitude than at sea level. This is achieved by breathing deeper and faster (i.e. hyperpnea) than
at sea level (see below).
There is, however, a complication that increases the
volume of air that needs to be inhaled per minute
(respiratory minute volume) to provide the same
amount of oxygen to the lungs at altitude as at sea
level. During inhalation, the air is warmed and
saturated with water vapor during its passage through
the nose passages and pharynx. Saturated water vapor
pressure is dependent only on temperature. At a body
core temperature of 37 degC it is 6.3 kPa (47.0 mmHg),
irrespective of any other influences, including
altitude.[31] Thus at sea level, where the ambient
atmospheric pressure is about 100 kPa, the moistened
air that flows into the lungs from the trachea consists of water vapor (6.3 kPa), nitrogen (74.0 kPa), oxygen
(19.7 kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases (a total of 100 kPa). In dry air the partial
pressure of O2 at sea level is 21.0 kPa (i.e. 21% of 100 kPa), compared to the 19.7 kPa of oxygen entering
the alveolar air. (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of [100 kPa - 6.3 kPa] = 19.7 kPa). At the
summit of Mt. Everest (at an altitude of 8,848 m or 29,029 ft), the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7 kPa, of
which 7.1 kPa (or 21%) is oxygen.[29] The air entering the lungs also has a total pressure of 33.7 kPa, of
which 6.3 kPa is, unavoidably, water vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen
entering the alveoli to 5.8 kPa (or 21% of [33.7 kPa - 6.3 kPa] = 5.8 kPa). The reduction in the partial
pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore substantially greater than the reduction of the total
atmospheric pressure at altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8 kPa vs. 7.1 kPa).
A further minor complication exists at altitude. If the volume of the lungs were to be instantaneously
doubled at the beginning of inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs would be halved. This happens
regardless of altitude. Thus, halving of the sea level air pressure (100 kPa) results in an intrapulmonary air
pressure of 50  kPa. Doing the same at 5500  m, where the atmospheric pressure is only 50  kPa, the
intrapulmonary air pressure falls to 25 kPa. Therefore, the same change in lung volume at sea level results
in a 50 kPa difference in pressure between the ambient air and the intrapulmonary air, whereas it result in a
difference of only 25 kPa at 5500 m. The driving pressure forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is
therefore halved at this altitude. The rate of inflow of air into the lungs during inhalation at sea level is
therefore twice that which occurs at 5500 m. However, in reality, inhalation and exhalation occur far more
gently and less abruptly than in the example given. The differences between the atmospheric and
intrapulmonary pressures, driving air in and out of the lungs during the breathing cycle, are in the region of
only 2-3 kPa.[18][19] A doubling or more of these small pressure differences could be achieved only by
very major changes in the breathing effort at high altitudes.
All of the above influences of low atmospheric pressures on breathing are accommodated primarily by
breathing deeper and faster (hyperpnea). The exact degree of hyperpnea is determined by the blood gas
homeostat, which regulates the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This
homeostat prioritizes the regulation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide over that of oxygen at
sea level.[6] That is to say, at sea level the arterial partial pressure of CO2 is maintained at very close to
5.3 kPa (or 40 mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial partial pressure of
O2, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory
response. However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the partial pressure of O2 in the ambient
air) falls to below 50-75% of its value at sea level, oxygen homeostasis is given priority over carbon dioxide
homeostasis.[6] This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about 2500 m (or about 8000 ft). If this switch
occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperpnea at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial partial
pressure of carbon dioxide, with a consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma. This is one contributor to
high altitude sickness. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then hypoxia
may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.
There are oxygen sensors in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles. In response to low partial pressures of
oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexively cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict.[32] (This is
the exact opposite of the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures of O2 cause
arteriolar vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the pulmonary arterial pressure to rise resulting in a much
more even distribution of blood flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level, the pulmonary
arterial pressure is very low, with the result that the tops of the lungs receive far less blood than the bases,
which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is only in the middle of the lungs that the blood and air
flow to the alveoli are ideally matched. At altitude, this variation in the ventilation/perfusion ratio of alveoli
from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more
or less the physiologically ideal manner. This is a further important contributor to the acclimatatization to
high altitudes and low oxygen pressures.
The kidneys measure the oxygen content (mmol O2/liter blood, rather than the partial pressure of O2) of the
arterial blood. When the oxygen content of the blood is chronically low, as at high altitude, the oxygen-
sensitive kidney cells secrete erythropoietin (EPO) into the blood.[33][34] This hormone stimulates the red
bone marrow to increase its rate of red cell production, which leads to an increase in the hematocrit of the
blood, and a consequent increase in its oxygen carrying capacity (due to the now high hemoglobin content
of the blood). In other words, at the same arterial partial pressure of O2, a person with a high hematocrit
carries more oxygen per liter of blood than a person with a lower hematocrit does. High altitude dwellers
therefore have higher hematocrits than sea-level residents.[34][35]
Irritation of nerve endings within the nasal passages or airways, can induce a cough reflex and sneezing.
These responses cause air to be expelled forcefully from the trachea or nose, respectively. In this manner,
irritants caught in the mucus which lines the respiratory tract are expelled or moved to the mouth where they
can be swallowed.[6] During coughing, contraction of the smooth muscle in the airway walls narrows the
trachea by pulling the ends of the cartilage plates together and by pushing soft tissue into the lumen. This
increases the expired airflow rate to dislodge and remove any irritant particle or mucus.
Respiratory epithelium can secrete a variety of molecules that aid in the defense of the lungs. These include
secretory immunoglobulins (IgA), collectins, defensins and other peptides and proteases, reactive oxygen
species, and reactive nitrogen species. These secretions can act directly as antimicrobials to help keep the
airway free of infection. A variety of chemokines and cytokines are also secreted that recruit the traditional
immune cells and others to the site of infections.
Other functions of the lungs
Local defenses
Surfactant immune function is primarily attributed to two proteins: SP-A and SP-D. These proteins can bind
to sugars on the surface of pathogens and thereby opsonize them for uptake by phagocytes. It also regulates
inflammatory responses and interacts with the adaptive immune response. Surfactant degradation or
inactivation may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to lung inflammation and infection.[36]
Most of the respiratory system is lined with mucous membranes that contain mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue, which produces white blood cells such as lymphocytes.
The lungs make a surfactant, a surface-active lipoprotein complex (phospholipoprotein) formed by type II
alveolar cells. It floats on the surface of the thin watery layer which lines the insides of the alveoli, reducing
the water's surface tension.
The surface tension of a watery surface (the water-air interface) tends to make that surface shrink.[6] When
that surface is curved as it is in the alveoli of the lungs, the shrinkage of the surface decreases the diameter
of the alveoli. The more acute the curvature of the water-air interface the greater the tendency for the
alveolus to collapse.[6] This has three effects. Firstly, the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion
of the alveoli during inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or non-compliant). Surfactant reduces the surface
tension and therefore makes the lungs more compliant, or less stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the
diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli have a
greater tendency to collapse (i.e. cause atelectasis) at the end of exhalation than at the end of inhalation.
Since surfactant floats on the watery surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the
alveoli shrink during exhalation.[6] This causes them to have a greater surface tension-lowering effect when
the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are
more widely spaced). The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of
exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the
alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to
negligible levels, and keeps the alveoli dry.[6][37]
Pre-term babies who are unable to manufacture surfactant have lungs that tend to collapse each time they
breathe out. Unless treated, this condition, called respiratory distress syndrome, is fatal. Basic scientific
experiments, carried out using cells from chicken lungs, support the potential for using steroids as a means
of furthering the development of type II alveolar cells.[38] In fact, once a premature birth is threatened,
every effort is made to delay the birth, and a series of steroid injections is frequently administered to the
mother during this delay in an effort to promote lung maturation.[39]
The lung vessels contain a fibrinolytic system that dissolves clots that may have arrived in the pulmonary
circulation by embolism, often from the deep veins in the legs. They also release a variety of substances that
enter the systemic arterial blood, and they remove other substances from the systemic venous blood that
reach them via the pulmonary artery. Some prostaglandins are removed from the circulation, while others
are synthesized in the lungs and released into the blood when lung tissue is stretched.
The lungs activate one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I is converted to the
aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, angiotensin II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other
tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on

arteriolar walls, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure.[40]
Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the
surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates
bradykinin. Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the
angiotensin I reaching the lungs is converted to angiotensin II in a single trip through the capillaries. Four
other peptidases have been identified on the surface of the pulmonary endothelial cells.
The movement of gas through the larynx, pharynx and mouth allows humans to speak, or phonate.
Vocalization, or singing, in birds occurs via the syrinx, an organ located at the base of the trachea. The
vibration of air flowing across the larynx (vocal cords), in humans, and the syrinx, in birds, results in sound.
Because of this, gas movement is vital for communication purposes.
Panting in dogs, cats, birds and some other animals provides a means of reducing body temperature, by
evaporating saliva in the mouth (instead of evaporating sweat on the skin).
Disorders of the respiratory system can be classified into several general groups:
Airway obstructive conditions (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis, asthma)
Pulmonary restrictive conditions (e.g., fibrosis, sarcoidosis, alveolar damage, pleural
effusion)
Vascular diseases (e.g., pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension)
Infectious, environmental and other ""diseases"" (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis, asbestosis,
particulate pollutants)
Primary cancers (e.g. bronchial carcinoma, mesothelioma)
Secondary cancers (e.g. cancers that originated elsewhere in the body, but have seeded
themselves in the lungs)
Insufficient surfactant (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome in pre-term babies) .
Disorders of the respiratory system are usually treated by a pulmonologist and respiratory therapist.
Where there is an inability to breathe or insufficiency in breathing, a medical ventilator may be used.
Cetaceans have lungs, meaning they breathe air. An individual can last without a breath from a few minutes
to over two hours depending on the species. Cetacea are deliberate breathers who must be awake to inhale
and exhale. When stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air.
As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the
'spout' and varies across species in shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this
characteristic.

The structure of the respiratory and circulatory systems is of particular importance for the life of marine
mammals. The oxygen balance is effective. Each breath can replace up to 90% of the total lung volume. For
land mammals, in comparison, this value is usually about 15%. During inhalation, about twice as much
oxygen is absorbed by the lung tissue as in a land mammal. As with all mammals, the oxygen is stored in
the blood and the lungs, but in cetaceans, it is also stored in various tissues, mainly in the muscles. The
muscle pigment, myoglobin, provides an effective bond. This additional oxygen storage is vital for deep
diving, since beyond a depth around 100 m (330 ft), the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the
water pressure.
Horses are obligate nasal breathers which means that they are different from many other mammals because
they do not have the option of breathing through their mouths and must take in air through their noses. A
flap of tissue called the soft palate blocks off the pharynx from the mouth (oral cavity) of the horse, except
when swallowing. This helps to prevent the horse from inhaling food, but does not allow use of the mouth
to breathe when in respiratory distress, a horse can only breathe through its nostrils.
The elephant is the only mammal known to have no pleural space. Instead, the parietal and visceral pleura
are both composed of dense connective tissue and joined to each other via loose connective tissue.[41] This
lack of a pleural space, along with an unusually thick diaphragm, are thought to be evolutionary adaptations
allowing the elephant to remain underwater for long periods while breathing through its trunk which
emerges as a snorkel.[42]
In the elephant the lungs are attached to the diaphragm and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather
than the expansion of the ribcage.[43]
The respiratory system of birds differs significantly from that
found in mammals. Firstly, they have rigid lungs which do not
expand and contract during the breathing cycle. Instead an

extensive system of air sacs (Fig.  15) distributed throughout
their bodies act as the bellows drawing environmental air into
the sacs, and expelling the spent air after it has passed through
the lungs (Fig. 18).[44] Birds also do not have diaphragms or
pleural cavities.
Bird lungs are smaller than those in mammals of comparable
size, but the air sacs account for 15% of the total body volume,
compared to the 7% devoted to the alveoli which act as the
bellows in mammals.[45]
Inhalation and exhalation are brought about by alternately
increasing and decreasing the volume of the entire thoraco-
abdominal cavity (or coelom) using both their abdominal and
costal muscles.[46][47][48] During inhalation the muscles
attached to the vertebral ribs (Fig.  17) contract angling them
forwards and outwards. This pushes the sternal ribs, to which
they are attached at almost right angles, downwards and
forwards, taking the sternum (with its prominent keel) in the
same direction (Fig. 17). This increases both the vertical and
transverse diameters of thoracic portion of the trunk. The
forward and downward movement of, particularly, the
posterior end of the sternum pulls the abdominal wall
downwards, increasing the volume of that region of the trunk
as well.[46] The increase in volume of the entire trunk cavity
reduces the air pressure in all the thoraco-abdominal air sacs,
causing them to fill with air as described below.
During exhalation the external oblique muscle which is
attached to the sternum and vertebral ribs anteriorly, and to the
pelvis (pubis and ilium in Fig. 17) posteriorly (forming part of
the abdominal wall) reverses the inhalatory movement, while
compressing the abdominal contents, thus increasing the
pressure in all the air sacs. Air is therefore expelled from the
respiratory system in the act of exhalation.[46]
During inhalation air enters the trachea via the nostrils and
mouth, and continues to just beyond the syrinx at which point
the trachea branches into two primary bronchi, going to the
two lungs (Fig. 16). The primary bronchi enter the lungs to become the intrapulmonary bronchi, which give
off a set of parallel branches called ventrobronchi and, a little further on, an equivalent set of dorsobronchi
(Fig. 16).[46] The ends of the intrapulmonary bronchi discharge air into the posterior air sacs at the caudal
end of the bird. Each pair of dorso-ventrobronchi is connected by a large number of parallel microscopic air
capillaries (or parabronchi) where gas exchange occurs (Fig. 16).[46] As the bird inhales, tracheal air flows
through the intrapulmonary bronchi into the posterior air sacs, as well as into the dorsobronchi, but not into
the ventrobronchi (Fig. 18). This is due to the bronchial architecture which directs the inhaled air away from
the openings of the ventrobronchi, into the continuation of the intrapulmonary bronchus towards the
Fig. 19 The cross-current respiratory gas
exchanger in the lungs of birds. Air is
forced from the air sacs unidirectionally
(from right to left in the diagram) through
the parabronchi. The pulmonary capillaries
surround the parabronchi in the manner
shown (blood flowing from below the
parabronchus to above it in the
diagram).[46][49] Blood or air with a high
oxygen content is shown in red; oxygen-

shades of purple-blue.

dorsobronchi and posterior air sacs.[50][51][52] From the
dorsobronchi the inhaled air flows through the parabronchi
(and therefore the gas exchanger) to the ventrobronchi from
where the air can only escape into the expanding anterior air
sacs. So, during inhalation, both the posterior and anterior air
sacs expand,[46] the posterior air sacs filling with fresh inhaled
air, while the anterior air sacs fill with ""spent"" (oxygen-poor)
air that has just passed through the lungs.
During exhalation the pressure in the posterior air sacs (which
were filled with fresh air during inhalation) increases due to the
contraction of the oblique muscle described above. The
aerodynamics of the interconnecting openings from the
posterior air sacs to the dorsobronchi and intrapulmonary
bronchi ensures that the air leaves these sacs in the direction of
the lungs (via the dorsobronchi), rather than returning down
the intrapulmonary bronchi (Fig.  18).[50][52] From the
dorsobronchi the fresh air from the posterior air sacs flows
through the parabronchi (in the same direction as occurred
during inhalation) into ventrobronchi. The air passages
connecting the ventrobronchi and anterior air sacs to the
intrapulmonary bronchi direct the ""spent"", oxygen poor air
from these two organs to the trachea from where it escapes to
the exterior.[46] Oxygenated air therefore flows constantly
(during the entire breathing cycle) in a single direction through
the parabronchi.[53]
The blood flow through the bird lung is at right angles to the
flow of air through the parabronchi, forming a cross-current
flow exchange system (Fig. 19).[44][46][49] The partial pressure
of oxygen in the parabronchi declines along their lengths as O2
diffuses into the blood. The blood capillaries leaving the
exchanger near the entrance of airflow take up more O2 than
do the capillaries leaving near the exit end of the parabronchi.
When the contents of all capillaries mix, the final partial
pressure of oxygen of the mixed pulmonary venous blood is
higher than that of the exhaled air,[46][49] but is nevertheless
less than half that of the inhaled air,[46] thus achieving roughly
the same systemic arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen as mammals do with their bellows-type
lungs.[46]
The trachea is an area of dead space: the oxygen-poor air it contains at the end of exhalation is the first air to
re-enter the posterior air sacs and lungs. In comparison to the mammalian respiratory tract, the dead space
volume in a bird is, on average, 4.5 times greater than it is in mammals of the same size.[45][46] Birds with
long necks will inevitably have long tracheae, and must therefore take deeper breaths than mammals do to
make allowances for their greater dead space volumes. In some birds (e.g. the whooper swan, Cygnus
cygnus, the white spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia, the whooping crane, Grus americana, and the helmeted

curassow, Pauxi pauxi) the trachea, which some cranes can be 1.5 m long,[46] is coiled back and forth
within the body, drastically increasing the dead space ventilation.[46] The purpose of this extraordinary
feature is unknown.
The anatomical structure of the lungs is less complex in reptiles
than in mammals, with reptiles lacking the very extensive
airway tree structure found in mammalian lungs. Gas exchange
in reptiles still occurs in alveoli however.[44] Reptiles do not
possess a diaphragm. Thus, breathing occurs via a change in
the volume of the body cavity which is controlled by
contraction of intercostal muscles in all reptiles except turtles.
In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs
inhalation and exhalation.[54]
Both the lungs and the skin serve as respiratory organs in amphibians. The ventilation of the lungs in
amphibians relies on positive pressure ventilation. Muscles lower the floor of the oral cavity, enlarging it
and drawing in air through the nostrils into the oral cavity. With the nostrils and mouth closed, the floor of
the oral cavity is then pushed up, which forces air down the trachea into the lungs. The skin of these
animals is highly vascularized and moist, with moisture maintained via secretion of mucus from specialised
cells, and is involved in cutaneous respiration. While the lungs are of primary organs for gas exchange
between the blood and the environmental air (when out of the water), the skin's unique properties aid rapid
gas exchange when amphibians are submerged in oxygen-rich water.[55] Some amphibians have gills, either
in the early stages of their development (e.g. tadpoles of frogs), while others retain them into adulthood (e.g.
some salamanders).[44]
Oxygen is poorly soluble in water. Fully aerated fresh water
therefore contains only 8-10 ml O2/liter compared to the O2
concentration of 210  ml/liter in the air at sea level.[59]
Furthermore, the coefficient of diffusion (i.e. the rate at which
a substances diffuses from a region of high concentration to
one of low concentration, under standard conditions) of the
respiratory gases is typically 10,000 faster in air than in
water.[59] Thus oxygen, for instance, has a diffusion coefficient
of 17.6  mm2/s in air, but only 0.0021  mm2/s in
water.[60][61][62][63] The corresponding values for carbon
dioxide are 16 mm2/s in air and 0.0016 mm2/s in water.[62][63]
This means that when oxygen is taken up from the water in
contact with a gas exchanger, it is replaced considerably more
slowly by the oxygen from the oxygen-rich regions small
distances away from the exchanger than would have occurred

Gills use a countercurrent exchange system that increases the
efficiency of oxygen-uptake from the water.[56][57][58] Fresh

water

through 
the 
mouth 
is
uninterruptedly ""pumped"" through the gills in one direction,
while the blood in the lamellae flows in the opposite direction,
creating the countercurrent blood and water flow (Fig. 22), on
which the fish's survival depends.[58]
Water is drawn in through the mouth by closing the operculum (gill cover), and enlarging the mouth cavity
(Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth
causing water to flow over the gills.[58] The mouth cavity then contracts, inducing the closure of the passive
oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth (Fig. 23).[58][65] The water in the
mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain
through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the inhalatory phase is
prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig.
23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as suction pump and pressure pump to maintain
a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction.[58] Since the blood in the lamellar capillaries flows in
the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains
steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower
diagram in Fig. 22). Oxygen is, therefore, able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and
the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water.[57] Although countercurrent exchange systems
theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas from one side of the exchanger to the
other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the
blood.[56]
In certain active pelagic sharks, water passes through the mouth and over the gills while they are moving, in
a process known as ""ram ventilation"".[66] While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills, as most
bony fish do, to ensure that oxygenated water continues to flow over their gills. But a small number of
species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are
obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is
also true of some pelagic bony fish species.[67]
There are a few fish that can obtain oxygen for brief periods of time from air swallowed from above the
surface of the water. Thus lungfish possess one or two lungs, and the labyrinth fish have developed a
special ""labyrinth organ"", which characterizes this suborder of fish. The labyrinth organ is a much-folded
suprabranchial accessory breathing organ. It is formed by a vascularized expansion of the epibranchial bone
of the first gill arch, and is used for respiration in air.[68] This organ allows labyrinth fish to take in oxygen
directly from the air, instead of taking it from the water in which they reside through the use of gills. The
labyrinth organ helps the oxygen in the inhaled air to be absorbed into the bloodstream. As a result,
labyrinth fish can survive for a short period of time out of water, as they can inhale the air around them,
provided they stay moist. Labyrinth fish are not born with functional labyrinth organs. The development of
the organ is gradual and most juvenile labyrinth fish breathe entirely with their gills and develop the
labyrinth organs when they grow older.[68]
Some species of crab use a respiratory organ called a branchiostegal lung.[69] Its gill-like structure increases
the surface area for gas exchange which is more suited to taking oxygen from the air than from water. Some
of the smallest spiders and mites can breathe simply by exchanging gas through the surface of the body.
Larger spiders, scorpions and other arthropods use a primitive book lung.
Most insects breath passively through their spiracles (special openings in the exoskeleton) and the air
reaches every part of the body by means of a series of smaller and smaller tubes called 'trachaea' when their
diameters are relatively large, and 'tracheoles' when their diameters are very small. The tracheoles make
contact with individual cells throughout the body.[44] They are partially filled with fluid, which can be
withdrawn from the individual tracheoles when the tissues, such as muscles, are active and have a high
demand for oxygen, bringing the air closer to the active cells.[44] This is probably brought about by the
buildup of lactic acid in the active muscles causing an osmotic gradient, moving the water out of the
tracheoles and into the active cells. Diffusion of gases is effective over small distances but not over larger
ones, this is one of the reasons insects are all relatively small. Insects which do not have spiracles and
trachaea, such as some Collembola, breathe directly through their skins, also by diffusion of gases.[70]
The number of spiracles an insect has is variable between species, however, they always come in pairs, one
on each side of the body, and usually one pair per segment. Some of the Diplura have eleven, with four
pairs on the thorax, but in most of the ancient forms of insects, such as Dragonflies and Grasshoppers there
are two thoracic and eight abdominal spiracles. However, in most of the remaining insects, there are fewer.
It is at the level of the tracheoles that oxygen is delivered to the cells for respiration.
Insects were once believed to exchange gases with the environment continuously by the simple diffusion of
gases into the tracheal system. More recently, however, large variation in insect ventilatory patterns has been
documented and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not demonstrate

continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of the spiracles. Others, however, utilize
muscular contraction of the abdomen along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate
cyclical gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most extreme form of
these patterns is termed discontinuous gas exchange cycles.[71]
Molluscs generally possess gills that allow gas exchange between the aqueous environment and their
circulatory systems. These animals also possess a heart that pumps blood containing hemocyanin as its
oxygen-capturing molecule.[44] Hence, this respiratory system is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The
respiratory system of gastropods can include either gills or a lung.
Plants use carbon dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis, and exhale oxygen gas as waste. The
chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 6 H2O (water), which in the presence
of sunlight makes C6H12O6 (glucose) and 6 O2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon
atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight.[72] Respiration is the opposite of
photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms
and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO2 which is easily removed from both the cells and
the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and oxidative metabolism to
use it.
Plant respiration is limited by the process of diffusion. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known
as stomata, that can open and close on the undersides of their leaves and sometimes other parts of their
anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for catabolic processes (break-down reactions that release
energy). But the quantity of O2 used per hour is small as they are not involved in activities that require high
rates of aerobic metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very high as they need CO2 for
photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1  g of glucose
requires the removal of all the CO2 from at least 18.7 liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the
photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.[72][73]

Anatomical terminology
Respiratory tract
The respiratory tract is the subdivision of the respiratory
system involved with the process of conducting air to the
alveoli for the purposes of gas exchange in mammals.[1] The
respiratory tract is lined with respiratory epithelium as
respiratory mucosa.[2]
Air is breathed in through the nose to the nasal cavity, where a
layer of nasal mucosa acts as a filter and traps pollutants and
other harmful substances found in the air. Next, air moves into
the pharynx, a passage that contains the intersection between
the oesophagus and the larynx. The opening of the larynx has a
special flap of cartilage, the epiglottis, that opens to allow air to
pass through but closes to prevent food from moving into the
airway.
From the larynx, air moves into the trachea and down to the
intersection known as the carina that branches to form the right
and left primary (main) bronchi. Each of these bronchi branches
into a secondary (lobar) bronchus that branches into tertiary
(segmental) bronchi, that branch into smaller airways called
bronchioles that eventually connect with tiny specialized
structures called alveoli that function in gas exchange.
The lungs which are located in the thoracic cavity, are protected
from physical damage by the rib cage. At the base of the lungs
is a sheet of skeletal muscle called the diaphragm. The
diaphragm separates the lungs from the stomach and intestines.
The diaphragm is also the main muscle of respiration involved
in breathing, and is controlled by the sympathetic nervous
system.
The lungs are encased in a serous membrane that folds in on itself to form the pleurae - a two-layered
protective barrier. The inner visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs, and the outer parietal pleura is
attached to the inner surface of the thoracic cavity. The pleurae enclose a cavity called the pleural cavity that
contains pleural fluid. This fluid is used to decrease the amount of friction that lungs experience during
breathing.
The respiratory tract is divided into the upper airways and lower airways. The upper airways or upper
respiratory tract includes the nose and nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, the pharynx, and the portion of the
larynx above the vocal folds (cords). The lower airways or lower respiratory tract includes the portion of the

respiratory tract or as separate entity and include the
respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and
alveoli.[3]
The respiratory tract can also be divided into a conducting
zone and a respiratory zone, based on the distinction of
transporting gases or exchanging them.
The conducting zone includes structures outside of the lungs
- the nose, pharynx, larynx, and trachea, and structures inside
the lungs - the bronchi, bronchioles, and terminal
bronchioles. The conduction zone conducts air breathed in
that is filtered, warmed, and moistened, into the lungs. It
represents the 1st through the 16th division of the respiratory
tract. The conducting zone is most of the respiratory tract that
conducts gases into and out of the lungs but excludes the respiratory zone that exchanges gases. The
conducting zone also functions to offer a low resistance pathway for airflow. It provides a major defense
role in its filtering abilities.
The respiratory zone includes the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli, and is the site of
oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange with the blood. The respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar ducts are
responsible for 10% of the gas exchange. The alveoli are responsible for the other 90%. The respiratory
zone represents the 16th through the 23rd division of the respiratory tract.
From the bronchi, the dividing tubes become progressively smaller with an estimated 20 to 23 divisions
before ending at an alveolus.[1]
The upper respiratory tract can refer to the parts of the respiratory system
lying above the sternal angle (outside of the thorax),[4] above the vocal
folds, or above the cricoid cartilage.[5][6] The larynx is sometimes included
in both the upper and lower airways.[7] The larynx is also called the voice
box and has the associated cartilage that produces sound. The tract consists
of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, the pharynx (nasopharynx,
oropharynx and laryngopharynx) and sometimes includes the larynx.
The lower respiratory tract or lower airway is derived from the
developing foregut and consists of the trachea, bronchi (primary, secondary and tertiary), bronchioles
(including terminal and respiratory), and lungs (including alveoli).[8] It also sometimes includes the larynx.
The lower respiratory tract is also called the respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree, to describe the
branching structure of airways supplying air to the lungs, and includes the trachea, bronchi and
bronchioles.[9]

At each division point or generation, one airway branches into two
smaller airways. The human respiratory tree may consist on average of 23
generations, while the respiratory tree of the mouse has up to 13
generations. Proximal divisions (those closest to the top of the tree, such
as the bronchi) mainly function to transmit air to the lower airways. Later
divisions including the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar ducts, and alveoli,
are specialized for gas exchange.
The trachea is the largest tube in the respiratory tract and consists of
tracheal rings of hyaline cartilage. It branches off into two bronchial tubes,
a left and a right main bronchus. The bronchi branch off into smaller
sections inside the lungs, called bronchioles. These bronchioles give rise
to the air sacs in the lungs called the alveoli.[11]
The lungs are the largest organs in the lower respiratory tract. The lungs are suspended within the pleural
cavity of the thorax. The pleurae are two thin membranes, one cell layer thick, which surround the lungs.
The inner (visceral pleura) covers the lungs and the outer (parietal pleura) lines the inner surface of the chest
wall. This membrane secretes a small amount of fluid, allowing the lungs to move freely within the pleural
cavity while expanding and contracting during breathing. The lungs are divided into different lobes. The
right lung is larger in size than the left, because of the heart's being situated to the left of the midline. The
right lung has three lobes - upper, middle, and lower (or superior, middle, and inferior), and the left lung has
two - upper and lower (or superior and inferior), plus a small tongue-shaped portion of the upper lobe
known as the lingula. Each lobe is further divided up into segments called bronchopulmonary segments.
Each lung has a costal surface, which is adjacent to the ribcage; a diaphragmatic surface, which faces
downward toward the diaphragm; and a mediastinal surface, which faces toward the center of the chest, and
lies against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where the two mainstem bronchi branch off from the base
of the trachea.
Respiratory epithelium
The alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place. The mean number of alveoli in a
human lung is 480 million.[12] When the diaphragm contracts, a negative pressure is generated in the thorax
and air rushes in to fill the cavity. When that happens, these sacs fill with air, making the lung expand. The
alveoli are rich with capillaries, called alveolar capillaries. Here the red blood cells absorb oxygen from the
air and then carry it back in the form of oxyhaemaglobin, to nourish the cells. The red blood cells also carry
carbon dioxide (CO2) away from the cells in the form of carbaminohemoglobin and release it into the
alveoli through the alveolar capillaries. When the diaphragm relaxes, a positive pressure is generated in the
thorax and air rushes out of the alveoli expelling the carbon dioxide.
The respiratory tract is covered in epithelium, which varies
down the tract. There are glands and mucus produced by goblet
cells in parts, as well as smooth muscle, elastin or cartilage. The
epithelium from the nose to the bronchioles is covered in ciliated
pseudostratified 
columnar 
epithelium, 
commonly 
called
respiratory epithelium.[13] The cilia beat in one direction,
moving mucus towards the throat where it is swallowed.
Moving down the bronchioles, the cells get more cuboidal in
shape but are still ciliated.
Glands are abundant in the upper respiratory tract, but there are
fewer lower down and they are absent starting at the
bronchioles. The same goes for goblet cells, although there are
scattered ones in the first bronchioles.
Cartilage is present until the small bronchi. In the trachea, they are C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage,
whereas in the bronchi the cartilage takes the form of interspersed plates. Smooth muscle starts in the
trachea, where it joins the C-shaped rings of cartilage. It continues down the bronchi and bronchioles,
which it completely encircles. Instead of hard cartilage, the bronchi and bronchioles are composed of elastic
tissue.
The lungs are made up of thirteen different kinds of cells, eleven types of epithelial cell and two types of
mesenchymal cell.[14] The epithelial cells form the lining of the tracheal, and bronchial tubes, while the
mesenchymal cells line the lungs.

Most of the respiratory tract exists merely as a piping system for air to travel in the lungs, and alveoli are the
only part of the lung that exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood.
Respiration is the rhythmical process of breathing, in which air is drawn into the alveoli of the lungs via
inhalation and subsequently expelled via exhalation. When a human being inhales, air travels down the
trachea, through the bronchial tubes, and into the lungs. The entire tract is protected by the rib cage, spine,
and sternum. In the lungs, oxygen from the inhaled air is transferred into the blood and circulated
throughout the body. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is transferred from returning blood back into gaseous form in
the lungs and exhaled through the lower respiratory tract and then the upper, to complete the process of
breathing.
Unlike the trachea and bronchi, the upper airway is a collapsible, compliant tube. As such, it has to be able
to withstand suction pressures generated by the rhythmic expansion of the thoracic cavity that sucks air into
the lungs. This is accomplished by the contraction of upper airway muscles during inhalation, such as the
genioglossus (tongue) and the hyoid muscles. In addition to rhythmic innervation from the respiratory center
in the medulla oblongata, the motor neurons controlling the muscles also receive tonic innervation that sets a
baseline level of stiffness and size.
The diaphragm is the primary muscle that allows for lung expansion and contraction. Smaller muscles
between the ribs, the external intercostals, assist with this process.
The epithelial lining of the upper respiratory tract is interspersed with goblet cells that secrete a protective
mucus. This helps to filter waste, which is eventually either swallowed into the highly acidic stomach
environment or expelled via spitting. The epithelium lining the respiratory tract is covered in small hairs
called cilia. These beat rhythmically out from the lungs, moving secreted mucus foreign particles toward the
Function
Respiration
Defences against infection
laryngopharynx upwards and outwards, in a process called mucociliary clearance, they prevent mucus
accumulation in the lungs. Macrophages in the alveoli are part of the immune system which engulf and
digest any inhaled harmful agents.
Hair in the nostrils plays a protective role, trapping particulate matter such as dust.[15] The cough reflex
expels all irritants within the mucous membrane to the outside. The airways of the lungs contain rings of
muscle. When the passageways are irritated by some allergen, these muscles can constrict.
The respiratory tract is a common site for infections.
Upper respiratory tract infections are probably the most common infections in the world.
The respiratory system is very prone to developing infections in the lungs. Infants and older adults are more
likely to develop infections in their lungs because their lungs are not as strong in fighting off these
infections. Most of these infections used to be fatal, but with new research and medicine, they are now
treatable. With bacterial infections, antibiotics are prescribed, while viral infections are harder to treat but
still curable.
The common cold, and flu are the most common causes of an upper respiratory tract infection, which can
cause more serious illness that can develop in the lower respiratory tract.
Pneumonia is the most common, and frequent lower respiratory tract infection. This can be either viral,
bacterial, or fungal. This infection is very common because pneumonia can be airborne, and when you
inhale this infection in the air, the particles enter the lungs and move into the air sacs. This infection quickly
develops in the lower part of the lung and fills the lung with fluid, and excess mucus. This causes difficulty
in breathing and coughing as the lower respiratory tract tries to get rid of the fluid in the lungs. You can be
more prone to developing this infection if you have asthma, flu, heart disease, or cancer[16]
Bronchitis is another common infection that takes place in the lower respiratory tract. It is an inflammation
of the bronchial tubes. There are two forms of this infection: acute bronchitis, which is treatable and can go
away without treatment, or chronic bronchitis, which comes and goes, but will always affect one's lungs.
Bronchitis increases the amount of mucus that is natural in your respiratory tract. Chronic bronchitis is
common in smokers, because the tar from smoking accumulates over time, causing the lungs to work harder
to repair themselves.[17]

Tuberculosis is one of many other infections that occurs in the lower respiratory tract. You can contract this
infection from airborne droplets, and if inhaled you are at risk of this disease. This is a bacterial infection
that deteriorates the lung tissue resulting in coughing up blood.[18] This infection is deadly if not treated.
Some of these cancers have environmental causes such as
smoking. When a tobacco product is inhaled, the smoke paralyzes
the cilia, causing mucus to enter the lungs. Frequent smoking,
over time, causes the cilia hairs to die and can no longer filter
mucus. Tar from the smoke inhaled enters the lungs, turning the
pink-coloured lungs black. The accumulation of this tar could
eventually lead to lung cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.[8]
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lower respiratory disease that can be caused
by exposure to harmful chemicals, or prolonged use of tobacco. This disease is chronic and progressive, the
damage to the lungs is irreversible and eventually fatal. COPD destroys the alveoli, and lung tissue which
makes breathing very difficult, causing shortness of breath, hyperventilation, and raised chest. The
decreased number of alveoli causes loss of oxygen supply to the lungs and an increased accumulation of
carbon dioxide. There are two types of COPD: primary and secondary. Primary COPD can be found in
younger adults. This type of COPD deteriorates the air sacs, and lung mass. Secondary COPD can be
found in older adults who smoke or have smoked and have a history of bronchitis. COPD includes
symptoms of emphysema and chronic bronchitis.[19]
The bronchi are the main passages to the right and left lungs.
These airways carry oxygen to the bronchioles inside the lungs.
Inflammation of the bronchii and bronchioles can cause them to
swell up, which could lead to an asthma attack. This results in
wheezing, tightness of the chest, and severe difficulty in
breathing. There are different types of asthma that affect the
functions of the bronchial tubes. Allergies can also set off an
allergic reaction, causing swelling of the bronchial tubes; as a
result, the air passage will swell up, or close up completely.[20]
In general, air is inhaled through the nose. It can be inhaled through the mouth if it is not possible to breathe
through the nose. However, chronic mouth breathing can cause a dry mouth and lead to infections.[21]

Root of the lung
The root of the lung is a group of structures that emerge at the
hilum of each lung, just above the middle of the mediastinal
surface and behind the cardiac impression of the lung. It is
nearer to the back (posterior border) than the front (anterior
border). The root of the lung is connected by the structures that
form it to the heart and the trachea.[1] The rib cage is separated
from the lung by a two-layered membranous coating, the
pleura. The hilum is the large triangular depression where the
connection between the parietal pleura (covering the rib cage)
and the visceral pleura (covering the lung) is made, and this
marks the meeting point between the mediastinum and the
pleural cavities.
The root of the right lung lies behind the superior vena cava
and part of the right atrium, and below the azygos vein. That of
the left lung passes beneath the aortic arch and in front of the
descending aorta; the phrenic nerve, pericardiacophrenic artery
and vein, and the anterior pulmonary plexus, lie in front of
each, and the vagus nerve and posterior pulmonary plexus lie
behind.[1]
The root is formed by the bronchus, the pulmonary artery, the
pulmonary veins, the bronchial arteries and veins, the
pulmonary plexuses of nerves, lymphatic vessels, bronchial
lymph nodes, and areolar tissue, all of which are enclosed by a
reflection of the pleura. The chief structures composing the root
of each lung are arranged in a similar manner from the front to
the back on each side. This means that the upper of the two
pulmonary veins are located anteriorly, the pulmonary artery is
in the middle, and the bronchus and bronchial vessels are
located posteriorly.[1] The arrangement on the two sides is not
symmetrical.[2]
Right side: (superior to inferior) eparterial bronchus, pulmonary
artery, hyparterial bronchus, and inferior pulmonary vein.[2]

Anatomical terminology
Left side: (superior to inferior) pulmonary artery, main
bronchus, and inferior pulmonary vein.[2]
On each hilum, there are hilar bronchopulmonary lymph nodes.
The visceral-parietal reflection surrounding the root of the lung extends downwards from the hilum to near
the base of the lower lobe in a sleeve-like fold called the pulmonary ligament. The lower rounded edge of
this is sometimes referred to as the inferior pulmonary ligament. At the lower edge of each lung, the pleural
layers come into contact with each other, and terminate in a free curved edge. The pulmonary ligaments
serve to anchor the larger lower lobes of the lungs in position and prevent potential torsion.
On chest X-ray, hilar enlargement can be due to lymphadenopathy and tumours (tuberculosis, bronchogenic
carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis), pulmonary hypertension or simply due to increased lung blood
flow.[3]

Thoracic diaphragm
The thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm
(/'daI@fraem/;[2] 
Ancient 
Greek: 
diaphragma,
romanized:  diaphragma, lit. 'partition'), is a sheet of internal
skeletal muscle[3] in humans and other mammals that extends
across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm is the
most important muscle of respiration,[4] and separates the
thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the
abdominal cavity: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the
thoracic cavity increases, creating a negative pressure there,
which draws air into the lungs.[5] Its high oxygen consumption
is noted by the many mitochondria and capillaries present; more
than in any other skeletal muscle.[4]
The term diaphragm in anatomy, created by Gerard of
Cremona,[6] can refer to other flat structures such as the
urogenital diaphragm or pelvic diaphragm, but ""the diaphragm""
generally refers to the thoracic diaphragm. In humans, the
diaphragm is slightly asymmetric--its right half is higher up
(superior) to the left half, since the large liver rests beneath the
right half of the diaphragm. There is also speculation that the
diaphragm is lower on the other side due to heart's presence.
Other mammals have diaphragms, and other vertebrates such as
amphibians and reptiles have diaphragm-like structures, but
important details of the anatomy may vary, such as the position
of the lungs in the thoracic cavity.
The diaphragm is an upward curved, c-shaped structure of
muscle and fibrous tissue that separates the thoracic cavity from
the abdomen. The superior surface of the dome forms the floor
of the thoracic cavity, and the inferior surface the roof of the
abdominal cavity.[7]
As a dome, the diaphragm has peripheral attachments to
structures that make up the abdominal and chest walls. The
muscle fibres from these attachments converge in a central
tendon, which forms the crest of the dome.[7] Its peripheral part
consists of muscular fibers that take origin from the
circumference of the inferior thoracic aperture and converge to
be inserted into a central tendon.

composed of two distinct muscle regions: the costal, which
serves as the driver in the work of breathing, and crural
diaphragm, which serves as an ""anchor;"" attaching the muscle
to the lower ribs and lumbar vertebrae. The costal diaphragm is
further divided into ventral, medial, and dorsal costal portions.
[8][9]
The vertebral part of the diaphragm arises from the crura and
arcuate ligaments. Right crus arises from L1-L3 vertebral bodies
and their intervertebral discs. Smaller left crus arises from L1, L2
vertebral bodies and their intervertebral discs.[8][7][10] Medial
arcuate ligament arises from the fascia thickening from body of L2
vertebrae to transverse process of L1 vertebrae, crossing over the
body of the psoas major muscle. The lateral arcuate ligament arises
from the transverse process of L1 vertebrae and is attached laterally
to the 12th rib. The lateral arcuate ligament also arises from fascia
thickening that covers the quadratus lumborum muscle. The median
arcuate ligament arises from the fibrous parts of right and left crura
where descending thoracic aorta passes behind it. No diaphramatic
muscle arises from the median arcuate ligament.[8] Both adrenal
glands lie near the diaphragmatic crus and arcuate ligament.[11]
The costal part of diaphragm arises from the lower four ribs (7 to
10) costal cartilages.[8]
The central tendon of the diaphragm is a thin but strong aponeurosis
near the center of the vault formed by the muscle, closer to the front
than to the back of the thorax. The central part of the tendon is
attached above to pericardium. The both sides of the posterior fibres
are attached to paracolic gutters (the curving of ribs before attaching
to both sides of the vertebral bodies).[8]
There are a number of openings in the diaphragm through which
structures pass between the thorax and abdomen. There are three
large openings -- one for the aorta (aortic hiatus),[3] one for the
esophagus (esophageal hiatus), and one for the inferior vena cava
(the caval opening),[8] as well as a series of smaller
openings.[12][13]
The inferior vena cava passes through the caval opening, a
quadrilateral opening at the junction of the right and middle leaflets
of the central tendon, so that its margins are tendinous. Surrounded
by tendons, the opening is stretched open every time inspiration
occurs. However, there has been argument that the caval opening
Openings
actually constricts during inspiration. Since thoracic pressure decreases upon inspiration and draws the caval
blood upwards toward the right atrium, increasing the size of the opening allows more blood to return to the
heart, maximizing the efficacy of lowered thoracic pressure returning blood to the heart. The aorta does not
pierce the diaphragm but rather passes behind it in between the left and right crus.
There are several structures that pierce through the diaphragm, including: left phrenic nerve pierces through
the central tendon, greater, lesser, and least thoracic splanchnic nerves pierces through bilateral crura, and
lymphatic vessels that pierce throughout the diaphragam, especially behind the diaphragm.[8]

The caval opening passes through the central tendon of the
diaphragm. It contains the inferior vena cava,[7] and some
branches of the right phrenic nerve.[14] The outermost wall of
inferior vena cava is fused with the central tendon.[8]
esophageal hiatus
T10
The esophageal hiatus is situated in the posterior part of the
diaphragm, located slightly left of the west central tendon through
the muscular sling of the right crus of the diaphragm.
It contains the esophagus, and anterior and posterior vagal
trunks,[7] left gastric artery and veins, and lymphatics.[8]
aortic hiatus
T12
The aortic hiatus is in the posterior part of the diaphragm, between
the left and right crus.
It contains the aorta, the thoracic duct and Azygous vein.[14]

The diaphragm is primarily innervated by the phrenic nerve which is formed from the cervical nerves C3,
C4 and C5.[7] While the central portion of the diaphragm sends sensory afferents via the phrenic nerve, the
peripheral portions of the diaphragm send sensory afferents via the intercostal (T5-T11)[8] and subcostal
nerves (T12).
Arteries and veins above and below the diaphragm supply and drain blood.
From above, the diaphragm receives blood from branches of the internal thoracic arteries, namely the
pericardiacophrenic artery and musculophrenic artery; from the superior phrenic arteries, which arise
directly from the thoracic aorta; and from the lower internal intercostal arteries. From below, the inferior
Nerve supply

phrenic arteries supply the diaphragm.[7]
The diaphragm drains blood into the brachiocephalic veins, azygos
veins, and veins that drain into the inferior vena cava and left
suprarenal vein.[7]
The sternal portion of the muscle is sometimes wanting and more
rarely defects occur in the lateral part of the central tendon or
adjoining muscle fibers.
The thoracic diaphragm develops during embryogenesis, beginning
in the third week after fertilization with two processes known as
transverse 
folding 
and 
longitudinal 
folding. 
The 
septum
transversum, the primitive central tendon of the diaphragm,
originates at the rostral pole of the embryo and is relocated during
longitudinal folding to the ventral thoracic region. Transverse
folding brings the body wall anteriorly to enclose the gut and body
cavities. The pleuroperitoneal membrane and body wall myoblasts,
from somatic lateral plate mesoderm, meet the septum transversum
to close off the pericardio-peritoneal canals on either side of the
presumptive esophagus, forming a barrier that separates the
peritoneal and pleuropericardial cavities. Furthermore, dorsal mesenchyme surrounding the presumptive
esophagus form the muscular crura of the diaphragm.
Because the earliest element of the embryological diaphragm, the septum transversum, forms in the cervical
region, the phrenic nerve that innervates the diaphragm originates from the cervical spinal cord (C3,4, and
5). As the septum transversum descends inferiorly, the phrenic nerve follows, accounting for its circuitous
route from the upper cervical vertebrae, around the pericardium, finally to innervate the diaphragm.
The diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration and functions in breathing. During inhalation, the
diaphragm contracts and moves in the inferior direction, enlarging the volume of the thoracic cavity and
reducing intra-thoracic pressure (the external intercostal muscles also participate in this enlargement),
forcing the lungs to expand. In other words, the diaphragm's movement downwards creates a partial
vacuum in the thoracic cavity, which forces the lungs to expand to fill the void, drawing air in the process.
Cavity expansion happens in two extremes, along with intermediary forms. When the lower ribs are
stabilized and the central tendon of the diaphragm is mobile, a contraction brings the insertion (central
tendon) towards the origins and pushes the lower cavity towards the pelvis, allowing the thoracic cavity to
expand downward. This is often called belly breathing. When the central tendon is stabilized and the lower
ribs are mobile, a contraction lifts the origins (ribs) up towards the insertion (central tendon) which works in
conjunction with other muscles to allow the ribs to slide and the thoracic cavity to expand laterally and
upwards.

diaphragm movement during

When the diaphragm relaxes (moves in the superior direction), air is
exhaled by elastic recoil process of the lung and the tissues lining
the thoracic cavity. Assisting this function with muscular effort
(called forced exhalation) involves the internal intercostal muscles
used in conjunction with the abdominal muscles, which act as an
antagonist paired with the diaphragm's contraction. Diaphragm
dysfunction is a well-known factor associated with various
complications in patients, such as prolonged respiratory failure,
difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation, extended
hospitalization, increased morbidity, and mortality.[15] Studies have
reported that a thin diaphragm leads to greater lung compliance,
which can contribute to respiratory failure. Furthermore, reduction
in diaphragm thickness during the early stages of disease can serve
as a prognostic marker in sepsis patients, and COVID-19
patients.[16][17]
The diaphragm is also involved in non-respiratory functions. It
helps to expel vomit, feces, and urine from the body by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, aids in
childbirth,[18] and prevents acid reflux by exerting pressure on the esophagus as it passes through the
esophageal hiatus.
In some non-human animals, the diaphragm is not crucial for breathing; a cow, for instance, can survive
fairly asymptomatically with diaphragmatic paralysis as long as no massive aerobic metabolic demands are
made of it.
If either the phrenic nerve, cervical spine or brainstem is damaged, this will sever the nervous supply to the
diaphragm. The most common damage to the phrenic nerve is by bronchial cancer, which usually only
affects one side of the diaphragm. Other causes include Guillain-Barre syndrome and systemic lupus
erythematosus.[19]
A hiatus hernia is a hernia common in adults in which parts of the lower esophagus or stomach that are
normally in the abdomen pass/bulge abnormally through the diaphragm and are present in the thorax.
Hernias are described as rolling, in which the hernia is beside the oesophagus, or sliding, in which the
hernia directly involves the esophagus. These hernias are implicated in the development of reflux, as the
different pressures between the thorax and abdomen normally act to keep pressure on the esophageal hiatus.
With herniation, this pressure is no longer present, and the angle between the cardia of the stomach and the
oesophagus disappear. Not all hiatus hernias cause symptoms however, although almost all people with
Barrett's oesophagus or oesophagitis have a hiatus hernia.[19]
Clinical significance

Hernias may also occur as a result of congenital malformation, a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. When the
pleuroperitoneal membranes fail to fuse, the diaphragm does not act as an effective barrier between the
abdomen and thorax. Herniation is usually of the left, and commonly through the posterior lumbocostal
triangle, although rarely through the anterior foramen of Morgagni. The contents of the abdomen, including
the intestines, may be present in the thorax, which may impact development of the growing lungs and lead
to hypoplasia.[20] This condition is present in 0.8 - 5/10,000 births.[21] A large herniation has high mortality
rate, and requires immediate surgical repair.[22]
Due to its position separating the thorax and abdomen, fluid
abnormally present in the thorax, or air abnormally present in the
abdomen, may collect on one side of the diaphragm. An X-ray may
reveal this. Pleural effusion, in which there is fluid abnormally
present between the two pleurae of the lungs, is detected by an X-
ray of the chest, showing fluid collecting in the angle between the
ribs and diaphragm.[19] An X-ray may also be used to reveal a
pneumoperitoneum, in which there is gas in the abdomen.
An X-ray may also be used to check for herniation.[20]
The adoption of a deeper breathing pattern typically occurs during physical exercise in order to facilitate
greater oxygen absorption. During this process the diaphragm more consistently adopts a lower position
within the body's core. In addition to its primary role in breathing, the diaphragm also plays a secondary
role in strengthening the posture of the core. This is especially evident during deep breathing where its
generally lower position increases intra-abdominal pressure, which serves to strengthen the lumbar
spine.[23]
The key to real core stabilization is to maintain the increased IAP while going through normal
breathing cycles. [...] The diaphragm then performs its breathing function at a lower position to
facilitate a higher IAP.[23]
Therefore, if a person's diaphragm position is lower in general, through deep breathing, then this assists the
strengthening of their core during that period. This can be an aid in strength training and other forms of
athletic endeavour. For this reason, taking a deep breath or adopting a deeper breathing pattern is typically
recommended when lifting heavy weights.
The existence of a membrane separating the pharynx from the stomach can be traced widely among the
chordates. Thus the model organism, the marine chordate lancelet, possesses an atriopore by which water
exits the pharynx, which has been claimed (and disputed) to be homologous to structures in ascidians and
hagfishes.[25] The tunicate epicardium separates digestive organs from the pharynx and heart, but the anus
returns to the upper compartment to discharge wastes through an outgoing siphon.

Thus the diaphragm emerges in the context of a body plan that
separated an upper feeding compartment from a lower digestive
tract, but the point at which it originates is a matter of definition.
Structures in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds have been called
diaphragms, but it has been argued that these structures are not
homologous. For instance, the alligator diaphragmaticus muscle
does not insert on the esophagus and does not affect pressure of the
lower esophageal sphincter.[26] The lungs are located in the
abdominal compartment of amphibians and reptiles, so that
contraction of the diaphragm expels air from the lungs rather than
drawing it into them. In birds and mammals, lungs are located
above the diaphragm. The presence of an exceptionally well-
preserved fossil of Sinosauropteryx, with lungs located beneath the
diaphragm as in crocodiles, has been used to argue that dinosaurs
could not have sustained an active warm-blooded physiology, or
that birds could not have evolved from dinosaurs. An explanation
for this (put forward in 1905), is that lungs originated beneath the
diaphragm, but as the demands for respiration increased in warm-
blooded birds and mammals, natural selection came to favor the parallel evolution of the herniation of the
lungs from the abdominal cavity in both lineages.[24]
However, birds do not have diaphragms. They do not breathe in the same way as mammals and do not rely
on creating a negative pressure in the thoracic cavity, at least not to the same extent. They rely on a rocking
motion of the keel of the sternum to create local areas of reduced pressure to supply thin, membranous
airsacs cranially and caudally to the fixed-volume, non-expansive lungs. A complicated system of valves
and air sacs cycles air constantly over the absorption surfaces of the lungs so allowing maximal efficiency
of gaseous exchange. Thus, birds do not have the reciprocal tidal breathing flow of mammals. On careful
dissection, around eight air sacs can be clearly seen. They extend quite far caudally into the abdomen.[27]

Trachea
The trachea (pl.: tracheae or tracheas), also known as the
windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube that connects the larynx to the
bronchi of the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is
present in almost all animals with lungs. The trachea extends
from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. At
the top of the trachea, the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the
larynx. The trachea is formed by a number of horseshoe-shaped
rings, joined together vertically by overlying ligaments, and by
the trachealis muscle at their ends. The epiglottis closes the
opening to the larynx during swallowing.
The trachea begins to form in the second month of embryo
development, becoming longer and more fixed in its position
over time. It is epithelium lined with column-shaped cells that
have hair-like extensions called cilia, with scattered goblet cells
that produce protective mucins. The trachea can be affected by
inflammation or infection, usually as a result of a viral illness
affecting other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx
and bronchi, called croup, that can result in a cough. Infection
with bacteria usually affects the trachea only and can cause
narrowing or even obstruction. As a major part of the
respiratory tract, when obstructed the trachea prevents air
entering the lungs and so a tracheostomy may be required if the
trachea is obstructed. Additionally, during surgery if mechanical
ventilation is required when a person is sedated, a  tube is
inserted into the trachea, called intubation.
The word trachea is used to define a very different organ in
invertebrates than in vertebrates. Insects have an open
respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and
tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues.
An adult's trachea has an inner diameter of about 1.5 to 2
centimetres (1/2 to 3/4 in) and a length of about 10 to 11 cm (4
to 41/4 in), wider in males than females.[2] The trachea begins at
the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx[3] at the
level of sixth cervical vertebra (C6)[2] and ends at the carina,
the point where the trachea branches into left and right main
bronchi.,[2] at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4),[2]

Anatomical terminology
although its position may change with breathing.[3] The trachea
is surrounded by 16-20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings'
are 4 millimetres high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped.[2]
Ligaments connect the rings.[3] The trachealis muscle connects
the ends of the incomplete rings and runs along the back wall of
the trachea.[3] Also adventitia, which is the outermost layer of
connective tissue that surrounds the hyaline cartilage,
contributes to the trachea's ability to bend and stretch with
movement.[4]
Although trachea is a midline structure, it can be displaced
normally to the right by the aortic arch.[5]
The trachea passes by many structures of the neck and chest
(thorax) along its course.
In front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin.[2]
Several other structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the jugular
arch, which joins the two anterior jugular veins, sits in front of the
upper part of the trachea. The sternohyoid and sternothyroid
muscles stretch along its length. The thyroid gland also stretches
across the upper trachea, with the isthmus overlying the second to
fourth rings, and the lobes stretching to the level of the fifth or sixth
cartilage.[2] The blood vessels of the thyroid rest on the trachea next
to the isthmus; superior thyroid arteries join just above it, and the inferior thyroid veins below it.[2] In front
of the lower trachea lies the manubrium of the sternum, the remnants of the thymus in adults. To the front
left lie the large blood vessels the aortic arch and its branches the left common carotid artery and the
brachiocephalic trunk; and the left brachiocephalic vein. The deep cardiac plexus and lymph nodes are also
positioned in front of the lower trachea.[2]
Behind the trachea, along its length, sits the oesophagus, followed by connective tissue and the vertebral
column.[2] To its sides run the carotid arteries and inferior thyroid arteries; and to its sides on its back
surface run the recurrent laryngeal nerves in the upper trachea, and the vagus nerves in the lower trachea.[2]
The trachealis muscle contracts during coughing, reducing the size of the lumen of the trachea.[3]

The thyroid gland also

cartilage.
The upper part of trachea receives and drains blood through the
inferior thyroid arteries and veins;[2] the lower trachea receives
blood from bronchial arteries.[3] Arteries that supply the trachea do
so via small branches that supply the trachea from the sides. As the
branches approach the wall of the trachea, they split into inferior
and superior branches, which join with the branches of the arteries
above and below; these then split into branches that supply the
anterior and posterior parts of the trachea.[3] The inferior thyroid
arteries arise just below the isthmus of the thyroid, which sits atop
the trachea. These arteries join (anastamoses) with ascending
branches of the bronchial arteries, which are direct branches from
the aorta, to supply blood to the trachea.[2] The lymphatic vessels of
the trachea drain into the pretracheal nodes that lie in front of the
trachea, and paratracheal lymph nodes that lie beside it.[2]
In the fourth week of development of the human embryo as the respiratory bud grows, the trachea separates
from the foregut through the formation of ridges which eventually separate the trachea from the
oesophagus, the tracheoesophageal septum. This separates the future trachea from the oesophagus and

divides the foregut tube into the laryngotracheal tube.[6] By the start of the fifth week, the left and right
main bronchi have begun to form, initially as buds at the terminal end of the trachea.[6]
The trachea is no more than 4 mm in diameter during the first year of life, expanding to its adult diameter of
approximately 2  cm by late childhood.[2][3] The trachea is more circular and more vertical in children
compared to adults,[3] varies more in size, and also varies more in its position in relation to its surrounding
structures.[2]
The trachea is lined with a layer of interspersed layers of column-shaped cells with cilia.[3] The epithelium
contains goblet cells, which are glandular, column-shaped cells that produce mucins, the main component of
mucus. Mucus helps to moisten and protect the airways.[7] Mucus lines the ciliated cells of the trachea to
trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx and then the pharynx where
it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled as phlegm. This self-clearing mechanism is termed
mucociliary clearance.[8]
The trachea is surrounded by 16 to 20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are incomplete and C-
shaped.[2] Two or more of the cartilages often unite, partially or completely, and they are sometimes
bifurcated at their extremities. The rings are generally highly elastic but they may calcify with age.

The trachea's main function is to transport air to and from the lungs. It also helps to warm, humidify, and
filter the air before it reaches the lungs.

Function
An example of stridor, which

The trachea is made up of rings of cartilage, which help to keep it open and prevent it from collapsing. The
inside of the trachea is lined with a mucous membrane, which produces mucus to help trap dirt and dust
particles. The cilia, which are tiny hairs that line the mucous membrane, help to move the mucus and
trapped particles up and out of the trachea.
Inflammation of the trachea is known as tracheitis, usually due to an infection. It is usually caused by viral
infections,[9] with bacterial infections occurring almost entirely in children.[10] Most commonly, infections
occur with inflammation of other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, known as
croup,[10][9] however bacterial infections may also affect the trachea alone, although they are often
associated with a recent viral infection.[9] Viruses that cause croup are generally the parainfluenza viruses
1-3, with influenza viruses A and B also causing croup, but usually causing more serious infections;
bacteria may also cause croup and include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus
pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis.[9] Causes of bacterial infection of the trachea are most commonly
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.[11] In patients who are in hospital, additional
bacteria that may cause tracheitis include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.[9]
A person affected with tracheitis may start with symptoms that suggest an upper respiratory tract infection
such as a cough, sore throat, or coryzal symptoms such as a runny nose. Fevers may develop and an
affected child may develop difficulty breathing and sepsis.[9][10] Swelling of the airway can cause
narrowing of the airway, causing a hoarse breathing sound called stridor, or even cause complete
blockage.[10] Up to 80% of people affected by bacterial tracheitis require the use of mechanical ventilation,
and treatment may include endoscopy for the purposes of acquiring microbiological specimens for culture
and sensitivity, as well as removal of any dead tissue associated with the infection. Treatment in such
situations usually includes antibiotics.[10]
A trachea may be narrowed or compressed, usually a result of
enlarged nearby lymph nodes; cancers of the trachea or nearby
structures; large thyroid goitres; or rarely as a result of other
processes such as unusually swollen blood vessels.[12] Scarring
from tracheobronchial injury or intubation; or inflammation
associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis may also cause a
narrowing of the trachea (tracheal stenosis).[12] Obstruction invariably causes a harsh breathing sound
known as stridor.[12] A camera inserted via the mouth down into the trachea, called bronchoscopy, may be
performed to investigate the cause of an obstruction.[12] Management of obstructions depends on the cause.
Obstructions as a result of malignancy may be managed with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.[12] A
stent may be inserted over the obstruction. Benign lesions, such as narrowing resulting from scarring, are
likely to be surgically excised.[12]

One cause of narrowing is tracheomalacia, which is the tendency for the trachea to collapse when there is
increased external pressure, such as when airflow is increased during breathing in or out, due to decreased
compliance.[13] It can be due to congenital causes, or due to things that develop after birth, such as
compression from nearby masses or swelling, or trauma.[13] Congenital tracheomalacia can occur by itself
or in association with other abnormalities such as bronchomalacia or laryngomalacia, and abnormal
connections between the trachea and the oesophagus, amongst others.[13] Congenital tracheomalacia often
improves without specific intervention; when required, interventions may include beta agonists and
muscarinic agonists, which enhance the tone of the smooth muscle surrounding the trachea; positive
pressure ventilation, or surgery, which may include the placement of a stent, or the removal of the affected
part of the trachea.[13] In dogs, particularly miniature dogs and toy dogs, tracheomalacia, as well as
bronchomalacia,[14] can lead to tracheal collapse, which often presents with a honking goose-like
cough.[15]
The trachea may be injured by trauma such as in a vehicle accident, or intentionally by another wilfully
inflicting damage for example as practiced in some martial arts.[16]
Tracheal intubation refers to the insertion of a tube down the trachea.[17] This procedure is commonly
performed during surgery, in order to ensure a person receives enough oxygen when sedated. The catheter
is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics. This is often one
of the responsibilities of an anaesthetist during surgery.
In an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a tracheotomy is often performed to
insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the
airway can be kept open. The provision of the opening via a tracheotomy is called a tracheostomy.[18]
Another method procedure can be carried, in an emergency situation, and this is a cricothyrotomy.[19]
Tracheal agenesis[20] is a rare birth defect in which the trachea fails
to develop. The defect is usually fatal though sometimes surgical
intervention has been successful.
A tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital defect in which the
trachea and esophagus are abnormally connected (a fistula). This is
because of abnormalities in the separation between the trachea and
oesophagus during development.[6] This occurs in approximately 1
in 3,000 births, and the most common abnormalities is a separation
of the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus, with the upper end
finishing in a closed pouch.[6] Other abnormalities may be
associated with this, including cardiac abnormalities, or VACTERL syndrome.[6] Such fistulas may be
detected before a baby is born because of excess amniotic fluid; after birth, they are often associated with
pneumonitis and pneumonia because of aspiration of food contents.[6] Congenital fistulas are often treated
by surgical repair.[12] In adults, fistulas may occur because of erosion into the trachea from nearby
Injury

Congenital disorders
malignant tumours, which erode into both the trachea and the oesophagus. Initially, these often result in
coughing from swallowed contents of the oesophagus that are aspirated through the trachea, often
progressing to fatal pneumonia; there is rarely a curative treatment.[12] A tracheo-oesophageal puncture is a
surgically created hole between the trachea and the esophagus in a person who has had their larynx
removed. Air travels upwards from the surgical connection to the upper oesophagus and the pharynx,
creating vibrations that create sound that can be used for speech. The purpose of the puncture is to restore a
person's ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed.[21]
Sometimes as an anatomical variation one or more of the tracheal rings are formed as complete rings, rather
than horseshoe shaped rings. These O rings are smaller than the normal C-shaped rings and can cause
narrowing (stenosis) of the trachea, resulting in breathing difficulties. An operation called a slide
tracheoplasty can open up the rings and rejoin them as wider rings, shortening the length of the trachea.[22]
Slide tracheoplasty is said to be the best option in treating tracheal stenosis.[23]
Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of an abnormally enlarged trachea, characterised by
absent elastic fibres, smooth muscle thinning, and a tendency to get recurrent respiratory tract infections.[24]
From 2008, operations have experimentally replaced tracheas, with those grown from stem cells, or with
synthetic substitutes, however this is regarded as experimental and there is no standardised method.[25]
Difficulties with ensuring adequate blood supply to the replaced trachea is considered a major challenge to
any replacement. Additionally, no evidence has been found to support the placement of stem cells taken
from bone marrow on the trachea as a way of stimulating tissue regeneration, and such a method remains
hypothetical.[25]
In January 2021, surgeons at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York performed the first complete trachea
transplantation. The 18-hour procedure included harvesting a trachea from a donor and implanting it in the
patient, connecting numerous veins and arteries to provide sufficient blood flow to the organ.[26]
Allowing for variations in the length of the neck, the trachea in other mammals is, in general, similar to that
in humans. Generally, it is also similar to the reptilian trachea.[27]
In birds, the trachea runs from the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary bronchi diverge. Swans
have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum; this may act as a resonator
to amplify sound. In some birds, the tracheal rings are complete, and may even be ossified.[27]
In amphibians, the trachea is normally extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear
primary bronchi. A longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked salamanders, and in caecilians.
While there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian trachea, these do not form the rings found
in amniotes.[27]

The only vertebrates to have lungs, but no trachea, are the lungfish and the Polypterus, in which the lungs
arise directly from the pharynx.[27]
The word trachea is used to
define 
a 
very 
different
organ in invertebrates than
in vertebrates. Insects have
an open respiratory system
made 
up 
of 
spiracles,
tracheae, and tracheoles to
transport metabolic gases to
and from tissues.[28] The
distribution of spiracles can
vary greatly among the
many orders of insects, but
in general each segment of
the body can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which
connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. The tracheae are invaginations of the
cuticular exoskeleton that branch (anastomose) throughout the body with diameters from only a few
micrometres up to 0.8 mm. Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place across the walls of the
smallest tubes, called tracheoles, which penetrate tissues and even indent individual cells.[29] Gas may be
conducted through the respiratory system by means of active ventilation or passive diffusion. Unlike
vertebrates, insects do not generally carry oxygen in their hemolymph.[30] This is one of the factors that
may limit their size.
A tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops
or helices. Taenidia provide strength and flexibility to the trachea. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae
may also be connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the
air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control the flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the

tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a gill, or function essentially as normal,
via a plastron. Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are lined with cuticular tissue and
are shed during moulting (ecdysis).[29]
